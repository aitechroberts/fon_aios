    "content": "HUNTSVILLE, Ala. -- The U.S. Army is about three months away from releasing its air and missile defense strategy for 2040, Lt. Gen. Sean Gainey, commander of the service's Space and Missile Defense Command, said Tuesday at the Space and Missile Defense Symposium.\n\nOne year ago, at the same conference in Huntsville, Alabama, Gainey announced that a strategy was in the works to address a variety of new and emerging complex threats and would roll that document out in October 2025.\n\n\"We are taking stock of lessons learned from the field, the increased options that artificial intelligence and advanced technology present and we are getting back to the basics, remembering mass has a quantity of its own,\" Gainey said.\n\nThe war in Ukraine and fighting in the Middle East have painted stark pictures of the challenges the Army will face when it comes to air and missile defense going forward.\n\nThe Army is planning to grow its air and missile defense capability by 30% over the next eight years, according to Gainey.\n\nThe last time the service released an air and missile defense strategy was in 2018, which was focused on the 2028 time period. That strategy centered on structure and force organization.\n\nNow, the new strategy must address rising battlefield challenges observed in real conflict and take into account the development of President Donald Trump's Golden Dome, a missile defense shield for the homeland.\n\nThe strategy, Gainey said, takes into account fundamental changes in how the Army will fight in combat, such as combining lethal and nonlethal capabilities, the integration of offensive and defensive fires, human-machine integration and the incorporation of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe advent of the Integrated Battle Command System, or IBCS, which is designed to connect any sensor to any shooter on the battlefield, will be \"in every formation,\" tying together disaggregated capability across the terrain for defense, and \"create pockets of areas of defensive priority where it is needed the most,\" Gainey said.\n\nAdditionally, the new strategy focuses on \"prioritizing smart missile defeat,\" Gainey said, which is the ability to get after the missile threat before it even leaves the ground.\n\nLeveraging missile defeat \"introduces a whole new element into the calculus,\" he said, because it addresses the mass challenge faced in modern warfare as threats come in larger and larger salvos.\n\n\"We can no longer look at it the same ... interceptor on interceptor,\" he noted. \"Missile defeat is one of the big areas inside of that strategy that we're really pushing across the department.\"\n\nOne of the key technology focus areas is incorporating artificial intelligence to address operator overload.\n\nOfficials have said AI will be an important aspect of homeland missile defense, particularly for Golden Dome, because defending large swaths of territory will require more than what manpower and systems alone can handle.\n\nThe Army sees growing involvement in homeland missile defense beyond managing the current Ground-based Midcourse Defense system.\n\n\"Space and Missile Defense Command already provides a defense to the homeland, and as we move forward, we see this command taking a larger role in the defense of the homeland,\" Gainey said.",

    "content": "MILAN - Finland has planned a live-firing event to assess the potential of laser-guided artillery munitions and their compatibility with Finnish weapons, which could provide the Nordic country with strategic advantages for long-range fires.\n\nThe logistics command of the Finnish Defense Forces (FDF) has launched a preliminary market survey to explore offerings of 155mm munitions with semi-active laser terminal homing.\n\nThese types of shells rely on a laser designator on the ground or another platform, such as a drone, to illuminate the target with a laser beam. Equipped with a laser guidance system, the shell can detect the reflected laser light and guide itself to the selected location.\n\n\"The FDF has started to plan its future on the use of special munitions such as 155mm munitions with semi-active-laser terminal homing,\" the notice said. \"The planning is in its early stages and it has not planned an exact schedule date to launch the possible procurement procedure.\"\n\nAdditionally, the assessment phase includes a live-fire demonstration event, planned for the fourth quarter of 2026.\n\nIn contrast to traditional, unguided artillery, this type of terminal guidance is reported by manufacturers to provide forces with increased accuracy, as it can correct deviations in the shell's trajectory in the final stage before impact.\n\nSuch an advantage can prove to be crucial, especially for militaries seeking to hit long-range targets.\n\nLeonardo and Diehl Defence are among the companies that have developed the Volcano 155, a family of artillery ammunition that includes guided projectiles equipped with a semi-active laser terminal homing sensor.\n\nAt the IDEF defense exhibition, held in Istanbul from July 22-27, Turkish company Roketsan showcased its new LG-155, an artillery round with semi-active laser guidance. According to the manufacturer, it can operate in areas where GPS navigation is contested.\n\nOver the last three years, both Russian and Ukrainian forces have made use of different laser-guided shells. Ukraine has also recently developed its laser weapon system, dubbed the Tryzub, which is claimed to be effective against detecting drones and diverse aerial threats.\n\nA significant downfall of laser-guided artillery munitions is that they are vulnerable to jamming, where countermeasures have the potential to interfere with the shell's laser signal, leading to it missing its engagement.",

Gen. Sean Gainey said Tuesday at the Space and Missile Defense Symposium in Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nThis force structure increase will take place over the next eight years, he added.\n\nThe plans align with the Army's recent push to increase air-and-missile defense capability across the board, as lessons learned in Ukraine and in the Middle East continue to reinforce the necessity of the capability. The service also acknowledges a need to develop a more layered defensive structure that can address wide-ranging threats, including swarms.\n\nThe Army's Patriot force has one of the highest operational tempos in the service, and a push to find a way to alleviate the pressure on those units has been ongoing for years.\n\nThe service believes one way to resolve that strain -- in addition to simply growing the Patriot force structure -- is to develop and field systems that can counter some of the proliferating threats on the battlefield, like drone swarms, cruise missiles or rockets, artillery and mortars with other capabilities like IFPC and counter-UAS systems.\n\nFielding five IFPC battalions aligns with the Army's plan to develop five Multidomain Task Force, or MDTF, units, that will be dedicated to specific combatant commands and be equipped with Long-Range Fires Battalions that will have Mid-Range Capability and Long-Range Hypersonic batteries, as well as IFPC battalions.\n\nThe Army previously indicated it wanted to complete that force structure by fiscal 2028.\n\nThe Army has also sent IFPC prototypes to South Korea to help the Army work on concepts to create a composite air-and-missile defense battalion.\n\nThe service is additionally planning to build a composite battalion that will include Patriot with LTAMDS and the Integrated Battle Command System, and IFPC to serve within the architecture of the Defense of Guam system currently under development.\n\nAs part of its sweeping Transformation Initiative announced in May, the Army also said it wanted to dramatically increase C-UAS capability throughout the service.

Randy George. The Army hopes to test the advanced technology in real-life formations even before the development phase has formally concluded.\n\n\"Our soldiers on Guam are at the tip of the spear for homeland defense and deserve the very best,\" Army Secretary Dan Driscoll told Defense News in a statement.\n\n\"We deployed the brand new [LTAMDS] radar to exercise in an operational environment. This radar will significantly improve the range and lethality of our weapon systems,\" he said. \"We're thrilled to test it in the [Indo-Pacific Command] region and continue making improvements as it comes online.\"\n\nThe Army is already beginning to integrate the sensors for testing and experimentation in order to continue to refine its capabilities in a real-world environment rather than within the confines of a testing range in the U.S.\n\nThe Pentagon is in the midst of developing a robust air-and-missile defense architecture to defend Guam from evolving threats.\n\nLTAMDS is slated to be a part of a comprehensive air-and-missile defense shield, which is currently under development on the island.\n\nAs the hostilities posed by China continues to grow, the Defense Department had pledged to deliver a foundational capability to help stave off a potential attack directed at Guam by the end of 2024. That schedule has slipped.\n\nGuam is an island of nearly 170,000 people that sits in a vulnerable position -- it is closer to Beijing than it is to Hawaii. The island plays host to a significant amount of U.S. combat power and would therefore be an attractive target for China in the event of a war in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nLTAMDS joins the Army's major missile defense asset there, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense System, or THAAD, which has been deployed to Guam since 2013.\n\nThe service developed LTAMDS to replace the current radar in Patriot air-and-missile defense systems, improving its detection and discrimination capability and giving it the ability to see threats from 360 degrees.\n\nIn addition to the two prototypes on Guam, the Army also plans to send another LTAMDS radar to Guam in 2027.\n\nThe Army approved LTAMDS for low-rate initial production in April. The service has been working to replace its aging Patriot system for over 15 years, initially running a competition for a full system before canceling those plans in favor of developing a new command-and-control system and radar separately.\n\nThe service awarded Raytheon a contract in 2019 to deliver prototypes over five years. Building the radar rapidly was an ambitious challenge and the Army decided to keep the sensor in testing for an extra year to ensure it was fully mature and ready for prime time.\n\nLTAMDS went through eight major missile flight tests along with roughly 10,000 hours of other testing, including radiate time, radar tracking time and testing against wind, rain, dust and road marches. The system is expected to reach full-rate production in 2028.\n\nThis fall, LTAMDS will participate in operational testing on Guam as part of the Army's Transformation in Contact initiative that puts new capability directly into the hands of soldiers that will operate it prior to formal fielding in order to further to refine the system and inform how it will be used in realistic operations.",

    "content": "President Donald Trump is gearing up to force companies to bend to his new whim, using more Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to run their business. On Tuesday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced a proposal to lay out the process by which companies could be approved to use drones in U.S. airspace and the rules they would have to follow.\n\nThe proposal comes about two months after President Trump signed an executive order on drones, in part to speed up the use of unmanned aerial vehicles by businesses in the United States.\n\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, are aircraft systems that operate without a human pilot onboard. They are remotely controlled or autonomously guided using software, sensors, and GPS technology. Originally developed for military and defense purposes, UAVs are now widely used in various industries, including agriculture, surveillance, delivery services, filmmaking, disaster response, and environmental monitoring.\n\nREAD: Do Trump's tariffs have Republicans running scared? (August 6, 2025)\n\nUAVs come in many sizes and designs, from small quadcopters to large fixed-wing aircraft. They can be equipped with cameras, thermal sensors, and other specialized tools to collect data or perform tasks in hard-to-reach or dangerous locations. The growing advancement in artificial intelligence and battery technology has significantly improved UAV efficiency, flight time, and capabilities.\n\nAs regulations evolve, UAVs are expected to play an even greater role in the commercial and public sectors. Despite their benefits, UAV use raises concerns around privacy, safety, and airspace regulation, which continue to be actively addressed by governments worldwide.\n\n\"Drone operators must navigate a labyrinth of ill-suited regulations designed for crude aircraft, placing an artificial ceiling on innovation and hampering progress,\" said Lisa Ellman, CEO of the Commercial Drone Alliance.\n\n\"In the meantime, we've seen our global peers and adversaries surge ahead in the deployment of commercial drone technology,\" she added.\n\nIn an emailed statement to NPR, the Air Line Pilots Association said it was committed to working with the Department of Transportation to \"ensure that emerging technologies and drone operations do not compromise aviation safety.\" The group added that \"[r]ecent tragic events have underscored the critical importance of maintaining rigorous safety standards in our increasingly complex airspace, and we will continue advocating for policies that require all airspace users to operate with adequate surveillance, communication, and collision avoidance capabilities.\"\n\nNPR reports that under the proposed rule, drones used by businesses would have to be built to certain industry standards and have collision avoidance technology to ensure they maintain a safe separation from other aircraft, including commercial airplanes.\n\nREAD: Trump to impose 25% tariffs plus penalty on India despite trade deal (July 30, 2025)\n\nThese measures also reflect growing concerns about national security, privacy, and the complexity of managing increasingly crowded skies. In addition to technical requirements, the rules emphasize operational accountability, encouraging businesses to adopt best practices.\n\nThe increasing integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) into commercial operations marks a significant shift in how businesses can operate in the modern age.\n\nThe recent proposal announced by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, following President Trump's executive order, reflects the government's intent to create a structured regulatory framework that encourages UAV innovation while maintaining strict safety and operational standards.\n\nBalancing progress with public safety remains critical. Measures such as industry-standard manufacturing, collision avoidance systems, restricted flight zones, and TSA security checks aim to ensure responsible use of UAVs without compromising aviation safety or public trust.",

    "content": "Hanwha Systems has completed the rollout of the first mass-produced active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar for South Korea's next-generation KF-21 fighter jet, marking a significant milestone in the nation's drive to develop advanced fighter avionics domestically.\n\nThe rollout ceremony, hosted by the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) and organized by Hanwha Systems, was held on August 5 at the company's Yongin R&D Center.\n\nThe event brought together more than 50 attendees, including senior officials from the Republic of Korea Air Force, DAPA, the Agency for Defense Development (ADD), and other key government and defense institutions.\n\nFollowing an initial production contract signed last year, Hanwha Systems finalized the full agreement earlier this year. Under the program, the company will deliver 40 AESA radar units between 2025 and 2028 for integration into the KF-21.\n\nOften referred to as the \"eyes\" of a fighter jet, AESA radars provide simultaneous multi-mission capabilities, including tracking airborne, ground, and maritime targets. Compared to legacy mechanically scanned radars, AESA technology enables faster target acquisition, broader coverage, and enhanced survivability by simultaneously engaging multiple threats.\n\nHanwha Systems began developing the radar in 2016 and unveiled its first prototype in 2020 -- just four years after development commenced -- demonstrating its indigenous radar capabilities to the global defense market. With the start of mass production, the radar is now ready for integration into the KF-21.\n\nThe rollout took place at a newly completed antenna testing facility at the Yongin R&D Center. Completed in late 2024 specifically for AESA radar development, the facility includes a Near-Field Chamber capable of testing up to four airborne radar systems simultaneously. It is equipped to evaluate core performance metrics and signal characteristics of AESA antenna arrays, each consisting of approximately 1000 transmit/receive (T/R) modules.\n\n\"Hanwha Systems is the one and only company in Korea to successfully develop, mass-produce, and export AESA radar systems,\" said Hyuk Park, Head of Hanwha Systems' Defense Electronics (DE) Division. \"We are expanding our global reach with scalable radar solutions tailored to a wide range of platforms -- from light fighters to unmanned aerial vehicles.\"\n\nIn May 2024, Hanwha Systems signed its first export contract for AESA radar antennas with Leonardo, a leading European defense and aerospace company. The agreement covers radar systems for light attack aircraft, marking the start of Korea's radar exports.\n\nKF-21 Boramae, a 4.5+ generation multirole fighter, marks a courageous leap in the South Korean aerospace ambitions. Developed by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) to replace aging F-4 and F-5 fleets, the KF-21 aims to bridge the gap between fourth- and fifth-generation fighters, offering advanced capabilities at a lower cost than platforms like the F-35.\n\nUnveiled in April 2021, with its maiden flight on July 19, 2022, the KF-21 is now in mass production, with 40 Block I aircraft slated for delivery to the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) by 2028.\n\nPowered by two General Electric F414 engines, the KF-21 boasts a top speed of Mach 1.81, a 2,900 km range, and a 7,700 kg payload across 10 external hardpoints. Its stealthy airframe, equipped with indigenous AESA radar, infrared search and track (IRST), and electronic warfare systems, surpasses the F-16 in range (50% greater) and airframe life (34% longer).\n\nThe aircraft integrates Western weaponry, including MBDA's Meteor missile, enhancing its air-to-air and air-to-ground roles. Future variants, like the Block III KF-21EX, will feature internal weapons bays, pushing it toward 5.5-generation status.\n\nThe program, launched in 2015, is a South Korea-Indonesia partnership, with Jakarta holding a 7.5% stake (reduced from 20% in 2024). Despite US restrictions on technology transfers, KAI developed critical systems domestically, reducing foreign dependency.",

    "title": "India completes C295 delivery from Spain to counter China and Pakistan border threats",
    "content": "The Airbus C295 is a tactical airlifter optimized for border ops, able to carry 71 troops or 9.2 tons of cargo (Picture source : Airbus).\n\nThe remaining 40 Airbus C295 will be produced in India by Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) in collaboration with Airbus under a full industrial partnership, making it the first time a military aircraft is being manufactured entirely in the Indian private sector. A new assembly line is being constructed in Vadodara, Gujarat, and is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2025. As part of the deal, Airbus has committed to a full transfer of technology and production knowledge, which includes the domestic manufacturing of over 14,000 parts and subassemblies, the development of skilled labor, and the establishment of a robust supply chain across Indian aerospace hubs in Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Nagpur. This program represents a strategic milestone under the Indian government's 'Make in India' and 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' (self-reliant India) initiatives and is expected to generate over 15,000 direct and indirect jobs in the defense sector.\n\nTechnically, the Airbus C295 is one of the most capable medium tactical airlifters currently in production. It is powered by two Pratt & Whitney PW127G turboprop engines, giving it excellent performance at high altitudes and in hot weather conditions, key requirements for operations in India's northern and northeastern frontiers. The aircraft can carry a maximum payload of 9,250 kg, including troops, vehicles, and cargo pallets, and has a rear-loading ramp for rapid embarkation and deployment. It can accommodate up to 71 fully equipped troops or 50 paratroopers and supports air-to-air and static line airdrop operations. The C295's operational range exceeds 2,300 km with full payload, and it can cruise at speeds up to 480 km/h. One of its most critical advantages is its ability to take off and land on short, soft, and semi-prepared airstrips as short as 670 meters, enabling it to operate in austere environments and remote forward areas with limited infrastructure. Additionally, it can be reconfigured for a wide variety of roles, including medical evacuation, signals intelligence, electronic warfare, search and rescue (SAR), and maritime patrol, making it a multi-mission force multiplier for the Indian Air Force.\n\nThe Airbus C295 represents a substantial technological advancement over the aging HS748 Avro aircraft it is replacing in the Indian Air Force inventory. Originally designed in the 1950s by British firm Avro, the HS748 is a twin-turboprop transport aircraft with a maximum payload capacity of approximately 5,800 kg and limited capability for short takeoff and landing (STOL) operations. It lacks a rear loading ramp and cannot accommodate modern palletized cargo or perform tactical airdrop missions efficiently. In contrast, the C295 features a more powerful propulsion system with Pratt & Whitney PW127G engines, a higher payload capacity of 9,250 kg, and advanced avionics including a digital glass cockpit and mission systems compatible with night operations and electronic warfare suites. Its STOL capability, reinforced landing gear, and rear cargo ramp allow for rapid loading and operations from unprepared airstrips, giving it superior operational flexibility. Furthermore, the C295 can be quickly reconfigured for multiple roles including MEDEVAC, paratroop deployment, and intelligence missions, making it a modern, multi-role tactical platform far more suitable for contemporary combat and humanitarian scenarios than the legacy HS748.\n\nThe strategic and geopolitical context surrounding the C295's induction is particularly significant. India continues to face a complex and evolving security environment characterized by heightened tensions with both Pakistan and China. Along the western border, although a ceasefire agreement with Pakistan has been in place since 2021, recent weeks have witnessed a sharp escalation in hostilities. A significant cross-border confrontation resulted in human casualties and material damage on both sides, underscoring the fragile nature of the ceasefire and the continued threat posed by infiltration attempts and militant activity. These developments remain a major concern for India's Northern Command, which must maintain a high level of readiness along the Line of Control. Meanwhile, the prolonged military standoff with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh continues, with both countries maintaining forward deployments and investing heavily in infrastructure and logistics along the contested frontier. China's rapid military modernization, increasing airpower deployments in Tibet, and strategic alignment with Pakistan pose a dual-front challenge to India's territorial integrity and operational preparedness.\n\nIn this high-stakes security environment, the C295 significantly enhances India's ability to conduct rapid force projection, forward logistics support, and quick-reaction deployments across sensitive border regions. Its ability to reach forward airstrips near the LAC, such as Daulat Beg Oldi, Nyoma, and Advanced Landing Grounds in Arunachal Pradesh, is a game-changer for high-altitude operations. From an operational standpoint, the C295 fills the capability gap between the smaller Dornier Do 228 and the heavier C-130J Super Hercules, enabling tiered air mobility for a range of tactical and humanitarian missions. It also improves inter-theater mobility, supports airborne operations, and enhances India's capability to respond to internal security threats, natural disasters, and regional contingencies in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).\n\nBeyond its tactical value, the program plays a critical role in positioning India as a future exporter of defense aerospace systems. The successful industrialization of the C295 in India could become a model for other countries seeking affordable, reliable, and locally supported tactical airlift solutions. With countries in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America expressing interest in the C295 platform, India could emerge as a regional manufacturing hub, supported by Airbus and aligned with global supply chains. This aligns with India's broader defense diplomacy and export strategy, allowing the country to project soft power while simultaneously achieving defense self-sufficiency.\n\nThe induction of the C295 also reflects India's maturing defense procurement strategy, which now emphasizes long-term capability development, domestic manufacturing, and strategic partnerships over purely off-the-shelf purchases. As more aircraft roll off the Vadodara assembly line in the coming years, India will not only reinforce its own national security architecture but will also take a decisive step toward becoming a key player in the global defense industrial ecosystem.",

    "title": "European Companies Crank Up Defense Production Plans | Aviation Week Network",
    "content": "To boost output or not to boost output is no longer the question for many European defense companies, since they have booming backlogs amid surging military spending. Their issue The question now is how to boost output cost-effectively.\n\nAcross Europe, production is increasing for everything from combat aircraft to missiles to air surveillance equipment. NATO members' commitment to higher spending targets at the alliance's June summit has only fueled companies' confidence that government pledges will turn into contracts.\n\n\"What we have seen in recent months, particularly the step-up in the NATO numbers and the success of the recent NATO summit, is our confidence around the durability of those sort of growth rates continuing,\" BAE Systems CEO Charles Woodburn said on the midyear earnings call.\n\nCranking up output is not straightforward and can take time. Leonardo CEO Roberto Cingolani said addressing the demand could require 30-40% more engineering hours, 10-15% more manufacturing work and 10-20% more strategic suppliers -- and that would come with huge costs.\n\nLeonardo suffered financially after investing heavily in commercial aircraft production capacity, only for it to be underutilized for a prolonged period. Now the company seeks to avoid similar missteps. \"We want to be lean, clean and agile,\" Cingolani said on the second-quarter earnings call.\n\nLeonardo has set up more than 170 projects to enable growth at lower cost. Those include the goal of increasing efficiency of helicopter manufacturing by 40% and fixed-wing aircraft production by about 35%. The company detailed plans to overhaul production sites, such as increasing automation and quintupling capacity at some locations. Leonardo will only pursue investments once those changes are made.\n\nDefense electronics provider Hensoldt has been scaling up since 2022 and is similarly looking ahead. \"With the German defense budget rising and visibility on future orders improving, we are preparing a step change in our operations,\" CEO Oliver D\u00f6rre said on the second-quarter earnings call. \"Our focus as management at the moment is to really set the prerequisite that we can digest these massive orders that we expect from the market.\"\n\nHensoldt reported a record order backlog and plans to spend the next several months assessing how to set the stage for having additional production capacity ready in 2027-28.\n\nThe past few weeks have only added urgency to those efforts. Germany, Hensoldt's home market, plans to boost defense spending for 2026 to more than \u20ac108 billion ($125 billion) -- a record -- with additional increases through 2029.\n\nMoreover, several countries have agreed to acquire the Diehl IRIS-T SLM air defense system, which uses Hensoldt's TRML-4D surveillance and targeting radar. Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland are among the IRIS-T's new customers, and Slovenia is looking to buy more. Hensoldt sees \u20ac2 billion in European potential for the radar.\n\nDemand is so strong for defense equipment that Safran CEO Olivier Andri\u00e8s expects the company's sales from those activities as well as space to double by decade-end. Safran generates about 20% of total revenue through its defense and space business, which includes landing gear and wiring.\n\nSafran makes engines for Dassault Aviation Rafale fighters and various military helicopters, as well as the AASM guided air-to-ground weapon, for which demand is increasing. AASM production has risen by a factor of four, and Safran has boosted output of turbojets for guided missiles about threefold. Missile engine output could swell higher, Andri\u00e8s said.\n\nMissiles are also hot items for BAE, which is a major shareholder of European missile joint venture MBDA, Woodburn said as the company lifted its full-year sales outlook. The Pentagon has been using BAE's APKWS laser-guided rocket in counterdrone operations. \"We're literally selling them as fast as we can make them,\" he added.\n\nSaab, having enjoyed overseas sales success for its Gripen fighter, is similarly looking to raise output. \"We will aim for at least a production rate of 20 aircraft a year,\" CEO Micael Johansson said on the second-quarter call.\n\nThe Swedish defense company is working with Thailand to finalize that country's purchase of 12 additional Gripens by year-end. Contract talks are underway with Colombia, which aims to replace its Israel Aircraft Industries Kfir with 16-24 Gripens. Saab is pursuing deals in the Philippines and Peru, where a selection may come soon.",

    "title": "Viettel develops low-altitude drones for search and rescue, defense operations",
    "content": "Viettel President Lieutenant General Tao Duc Thang said Viettel has started researching low-altitude unmanned and manned aerial vehicles to be used for both economic and defense purposes.\n\nRecently, Viettel used a drone to provide rapid response during natural disasters, addressing the telecommunications network disruptions in Nghe An in late July. The drone, which carried a mobile 4G/5G broadcasting device, at an altitude of about 50-100m, covering a radius of up to 6km, operated for 24 hours thanks to energy via a hybrid cable from the ground.\n\nViettel said drones can be combined with satellite broadcasting and can reach flooded areas, landslides or mountainous terrain covered by dense conditions, and cable lines; and can also handle isolated routes where broadcast vehicles cannot reach, ensuring smooth communication for search and rescue work.\n\nAt the Vietnam International Defense Exhibition 2024, Viettel showcased over 80 high-tech products in the defense industry, notably unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) designed and manufactured 100 percent domestically by Viettel.\n\nIt has developed reconnaissance UAVs (VU-R50, VU-R70) capable of vertical takeoff/landing, flying for 3-6 hours uninterruptedly, with a combat range of about 70km, equipped with HD cameras, infrared, laser rangefinders, and AI for automatic target recognition and real-time data transmission.\n\nViettel has also developed multi-purpose UAVs capable of flying over 12 hours, operating at a range exceeding 1,000km, and carrying high-precision weapons, enhancing multi-environment combat capabilities.\n\nIn addition, Viettel has developed the VU-C2 suicide UAV with a maximum weight of 8kg, a flight time of 40 minutes, and an attack speed of over 130km/h.

    "title": "Ukraine unveils robotic platform for launching multiple FPV drones simultaneously - photos, video",
    "content": "Ukrainian company IRV has developed a ground robotic platform called Karakurt, designed for the remote launch of multiple drones. The system, which can deploy up to six UAVs, was unveiled for the first time at IRON DEMO 2025.\n\nSource: Oboronka, a defence industry project by Mezha.Media, a technology and IT news platform within Ukrainska Pravda's holding company\n\nDetails: The Karakurt system is mounted on the tracked ground robotic platform Vepryk, equipped with two rails holding three FPV drones each. The concept behind the design is to enable drone launches from locations far removed from operators or Ukrainian positions. Additionally, the system can remain on standby around the clock in high-threat areas and activate upon detecting enemy targets.\n\nThe drones are operated either via an integrated onboard retransmitter or through an aerial relay station, which can be launched from the platform itself or from nearby positions. This allows the drones to operate at ranges of up to 30 km. The robotic platform can be deployed up to 4 km away from the communication hub.\n\nKarakurt supports both individual and dual-drone launches. In dual mode, two drones are controlled via a single remote, with the operator able to switch between them. Both drones can strike the same target: the second drone follows 30-40 metres behind the lead and automatically locks onto the same point of impact.\n\n\"There may be a slight margin of error, as the drones separate and are affected by airflows, among other factors. But that gap is actually useful. If we're targeting a large road or a Russian logistics convoy, drones spaced 30 metres apart can hit two separate vehicles. This also works well against clusters of enemy equipment or railway targets, such as a long train with dozens of wagons - it helps neutralise any targeting inaccuracy of the second drone,\" says Andrii Malyshev, IRV chief engineer.\n\nThe company plans to develop swarming capabilities using artificial intelligence.\n\nCurrently, the platform is fitted with 13-inch drones. A solution already exists that allows the launch of not only kamikaze drones but also reusable bombers - although for now, they must return to the original launch point, as the platform's drone-landing system is still in development.\n\nIRV is also working on integrating larger 15-inch drones, which would increase the system's range and power.\n\n\"Our record so far - achieved by the 42nd Brigade - was a one-way flight of 32.5 km with a 2.6 kg payload. That means we can reliably hit targets 30 km away carrying 3 kg. Now add the 4 km distance from the command post to the launch platform - that's over 34 km effective range. And if we reduce the payload and boost the signal relays, we could reach targets up to 40 km away,\" Malyshev says.\n\nWhen asked whether sensitive drone components might get dusty as the platform moves into position, Malyshev noted that IRV currently coats critical parts with an aerosol film. Moreover, the drone's propellers quickly blow off dust from its structure during launch.\n\nThe cost of one Karakurt unit is approximately UAH 2 million (approx. US$47,000), with half of that amount covering the aerial component - 12 drones, relays, and software - and the other half going to the ground platform.\n\nIRV says it is in no hurry to codify its technology due to the ongoing need to adapt frequencies and improve the product. Codification, the developers argue, would significantly reduce the flexibility to upgrade the system.\n\nAt the same event, other military innovations were also showcased, including a universal auto-targeting module for FPV drones developed by Ukrainian company Dwarf Engineering.",

    "content": "The V-BAT 128 is a VTOL drone with AI-driven autonomy, 11-hour endurance, and multi-mission capability for ISR and electronic warfare (Picture source: U.S. DoD)\n\nThe V-BAT 128 is a Group 3 tactical unmanned aerial system optimized for expeditionary ISR, electronic warfare, and multi-mission flexibility. It features a tail-sitter configuration that allows for true vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), eliminating the need for runways, launch rails, or recovery systems. This design enables the V-BAT to operate from confined decks aboard naval vessels, rugged terrain, or narrow jungle clearings, making it highly adaptable to Colombia's operational environment. With a maximum gross takeoff weight (GTOW) of approximately 125 pounds (56.7 kilograms), the V-BAT 128 achieves a balance between endurance, payload capacity, and portability.\n\nPowered by a fuel-injected, single-cylinder piston engine, the UAV can maintain flight for up to 11 hours depending on payload configuration and environmental conditions. It has a line-of-sight range of more than 600 kilometers, with optional satellite communications (SATCOM) enabling beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) operations over strategic distances. The platform supports a payload capacity of up to 25 pounds (11.3 kilograms), and its modular bay accommodates a wide range of sensors, including high-resolution EO/IR gimbals, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), wide-area motion imagery (WAMI), hyperspectral sensors, electronic intelligence (ELINT) kits, and communications relay systems.\n\nAt the core of the V-BAT 128's autonomous functionality is Shield AI's Hivemind software, an AI-based flight control system that enables real-time autonomous decision-making, adaptive flight routing, and collaborative mission execution among multiple UAVs. Unlike traditional UAS platforms that rely heavily on human-in-the-loop control, Hivemind allows the V-BAT 128 to operate with minimal operator input, navigate GPS-denied environments using onboard visual-inertial odometry, and dynamically adjust mission parameters based on evolving battlefield conditions. This autonomy is crucial in high-threat zones where EW jamming, terrain masking, or satellite degradation can disrupt conventional UAV control links.\n\nDuring the exhibition, Shield AI representatives emphasized the platform's successful deployment history with U.S. Navy expeditionary units, U.S. Marine Corps reconnaissance forces, and Special Operations Command (SOCOM). In these roles, the V-BAT 128 has performed ISR overwatch, precision targeting support, comms bridging, and mission-critical battlefield assessments. Its ruggedized ground control station (GCS), designed for rapid setup and intuitive use, enables two-person crews to operate the system with full payload control, live sensor feed exploitation, and on-the-fly mission replanning. The UAV also features fault-tolerant systems and failsafe protocols for autonomous recovery in case of signal loss or component failure.\n\nThe Colombian Navy's assessment of the V-BAT 128 aligns with its current efforts to integrate Western defense technologies that enhance force modernization, improve multi-domain awareness, and reduce dependency on legacy platforms. In 2024, the Colombian Ministry of Defense outlined a revised ISR doctrine emphasizing rapid intelligence exploitation, flexible deployment assets, and operational autonomy in high-risk zones. The Navy in particular is looking to expand its maritime ISR coverage for anti-smuggling operations, monitor EEZ violations, and support amphibious force deployments along rivers and coastlines.\n\nIf selected, the V-BAT 128 would represent a leap in Colombia's unmanned capability, potentially becoming one of the most advanced operational UAVs in service in Latin America. The system's ability to support ISR, EW, SIGINT, comms relay, and maritime interdiction missions in a single, rapidly deployable platform positions it as a force multiplier in both conventional and asymmetric conflict scenarios. Its VTOL capability also opens up future integration with uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) and mobile command centers, expanding Colombia's ISR network into a multi-domain sensor web.\n\nColombia's interest in acquiring next-generation UAV platforms like the V-BAT 128 stems from enduring internal and transnational security threats. Decades-long conflicts with guerrilla factions, such as the National Liberation Army (ELN), combined with the powerful presence of organized narcotics trafficking networks, have created persistent security challenges across Colombia's expansive territory. Key corridors used by drug cartels run through dense Amazonian jungle, remote river systems, and unmonitored maritime zones in both the Pacific and Caribbean regions. Traditional manned ISR platforms face operational limitations in these areas due to cost, risk exposure, and environmental constraints. Colombia's defense strategy has therefore shifted toward modular, AI-enhanced unmanned systems capable of delivering continuous surveillance, autonomous navigation, and long-endurance coverage with minimal logistical demand. UAVs like the V-BAT 128 present an effective solution to fill ISR gaps in inaccessible areas while reducing reliance on manpower-intensive patrols.\n\nDiscussions are reportedly underway between Shield AI and Colombian defense procurement officials regarding a potential series of evaluation trials and limited field deployments beginning in late 2025. These tests may involve deployment from Colombian Navy offshore patrol vessels (OPVs), Amazon riverine patrol posts, and forward-deployed jungle outposts. Shield AI has indicated its willingness to customize payloads and communications configurations to meet Colombian mission profiles and compliance requirements.\n\nColombia navigates its strategic pivot toward autonomous warfare systems, the potential adoption of the V-BAT 128 may mark a significant milestone in regional unmanned aerial capabilities and the growing influence of U.S.-based AI defense technologies in Latin American defense modernization programs.",

    "title": "South Korea's future KF-21EX stealth fighter to match capabilities of US F-35 with AI and internal bay",
    "content": "The KF-21EX is also designed to serve as the central manned component in South Korea's emerging Next Air Combat System (NACS), a distributed network involving manned-unmanned teaming, drone integration, and multi-domain operations. (Picture source: KAI)\n\nThis capability allows the KF-21EX to deliver heavy strike payloads against hardened targets such as bunkers without compromising low observability, a feature currently available only in aircraft like the F-35, Su-57, and J-20. From an aerodynamic perspective, internal storage reduces drag compared to external hardpoints, resulting in better fuel efficiency, higher top speed, and extended mission range. In combat scenarios, internal carriage improves energy retention after maneuvers and enhances flight characteristics by preserving the lift-to-drag ratio, especially during sustained turns or supersonic cruising. More importantly, it avoids increases in radar signature caused by external pylons, making the internal bay a core element in the KF-21's transformation into a stealth aircraft. Modern stealth jets like the F-22 and F-35 employ this approach to maintain signature control throughout a mission. Although internal bays impose limitations on payload volume and require complex mechanical systems, they are essential for operations in contested airspace protected by advanced integrated air defense systems.\n\nSouth\u202fKorea's KF\u201121EX is poised to challenge the F\u201135 in stealth by adopting core design elements of a true stealth fighter. Unlike the current KF\u201121, which lacks internal weapon storage, the KF\u201121EX adds internal weapons bays to dramatically reduce radar cross\u2011section, just like the F\u201135's twin internal bays that hide smart bombs and missiles within the aircraft's smooth contours. While the F\u201135 has proven stealth through shaping, RAM coatings, diverterless inlets, and low\u2011observable nozzles, which combined can make its radar signature smaller than a metal golf ball, the KF\u201121EX aims to reach similar levels by adding radar\u2011absorbing materials, stealth-optimized exhaust, and conformal sensors. Although the F\u201135 benefits from decades of real-world stealth operations and software\u2011defined avionics, the KF\u201121EX seeks to bridge that gap by pairing internal carriage with integrated sensor fusion and AI data links in a 5.5\u2011generation architecture. In sum, the KF\u201121EX represents South Korea's leap toward domain\u2011level stealth capability, using internal weapons bay design and signature management to approach the radar invisibility standards set by the F\u201135.\n\nTo support this evolution, the KF-21EX incorporates a complete suite of structural and electronic upgrades. The canopy and radome have been reprofiled to reduce reflective angles, while radar-absorbent materials (RAM) and radar-absorbing structures (RAS) are applied across the fuselage and control surfaces. Stealth-optimized exhaust nozzles are included to suppress infrared signatures, and conformal antennas and embedded sensors are integrated to eliminate external protrusions. Sensor systems comprise an Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), an Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System (EODAS), and an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar with Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) and Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR). These sensors are fused via high-speed optical and satellite-linked datalinks, processed by an AI-enabled mission computer providing targeting assistance, threat prioritization, and flight-path optimization. KAI has confirmed that Leonardo's BriteCloud expendable DRFM decoys will also be integrated to enhance survivability in radar-guided threat environments. Collectively, these upgrades place the KF-21EX within the 5.5-generation aircraft category, according to South Korean analysts.\n\nThe KF-21EX is intended to serve as the core manned asset in South Korea's emerging Next Air Combat System (NACS), a distributed operational architecture involving manned-unmanned teaming, drone integration, and multi-domain warfare. KAI envisions the EX operating alongside unmanned platforms such as the LOWUS, coordinating strike missions, conducting escort jamming, and sharing sensor tracks in real time. While the KF-21EX performs escort jamming, accompanying drones will function as stand-in jammers, penetrating contested zones to suppress or deceive enemy air defense radars. MUM-T operations will rely on secure datalink connectivity, AI-managed sensor fusion, and decentralized targeting frameworks. This distributed model will enable the KF-21EX and its drone partners to simultaneously attack dispersed targets, analyze threat vectors, and operate independently of centralized command structures. The overall system will include AI pilots, autonomous onboard management, swarm drone coordination, and potential integration of laser weapons. These capabilities are projected to define the NACS architecture by the 2040s, positioning the KF-21EX as its principal manned component.\n\nThe KF-X program began in 2001 with the aim of developing an indigenous fighter to replace the aging F-4 and F-5 fleets of the Republic of Korea Air Force. Following a decade of feasibility studies, propulsion assessments, and airframe design trials, the C103 twin-engine configuration was selected in 2014, and full-scale development commenced in 2015. The first KF-21 prototype flew on July 19, 2022. By mid-2025, six prototypes, including two-seat variants, had completed over 1,300 flight tests, reaching a top speed of Mach 1.8 and surpassing 1,000 accident-free sorties by November 2024. Block I production began in 2024 with an initial order of 20 aircraft, followed by a second order for 20 more in June 2025. Deliveries are scheduled from late 2026 through 2032, targeting a fleet of 120 units. Block II, offering multirole air-to-ground enhancements, is expected to reach operational readiness by 2028. The KF-21EX Block III is projected to mature operationally around 2039. According to KAI's 2024 roadmap, the EX will also serve as the base for a future sixth-generation fighter, potentially incorporating tailless designs, directed energy weapons, and autonomous AI systems.\n\nThe KF-21EX retains the twin-engine layout of its predecessor, powered by two General Electric F414-GE-400K afterburning turbofans. Each engine generates approximately 14,400 pounds of thrust in dry conditions and up to 22,000 pounds with afterburner, supporting a maximum speed of Mach 1.8. The airframe accommodates a maximum takeoff weight of around 25,600 kilograms and a payload capacity approaching 7,700 kilograms. The aircraft measures approximately 16.9 meters in length, has a wingspan of 11.2 meters, and stands 4.7 meters tall. It features fly-by-wire controls, a glass cockpit with wide-area multifunction displays, and a side-stick control system. The aircraft's operational range and endurance are enhanced by aerodynamic refinements and the internal weapon carriage, which reduces drag. Its clean profile and fuel efficiency enable it to undertake both air superiority and deep-strike missions without external tanks during the initial phase. A refueling probe allows for extended-range missions when stealth requirements are relaxed. Designed with modularity in mind, the KF-21EX is prepared for future integration of advanced systems, including AI-managed mission payloads and directed energy weapons, aligning with the long-term evolution of South Korea's air combat strategy.\n\nIn addition to the KF-21EX, two further variants are under conceptual development: the KF-21EA for electronic attack and the KF-21SA for export. The EA variant, inspired by the U.S. Navy's EA-18G Growler, is intended for Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions using escort jamming and anti-radiation weapons such as the AARGM-ER. It will likely be based on the twin-seat KF-21B, with an electronic warfare officer in the rear seat. Its configuration is expected to include three jamming pods, two high-frequency and one low-frequency, plus two electronic support measure (ESM) pods mounted on the wingtips for threat detection and signal analysis. Structural reinforcements will permit simultaneous deployment of jamming systems, anti-radiation missiles, and air-to-air weaponry. The KF-21SA is being developed for international clients and will likely use the same airframe as the Republic of Korea Air Force variant, with modifications based on customer requirements. Despite visibility surrounding all three variants, officials caution that full-scale development remains at the conceptual stage and that the KF-21EX and EA will require at least another decade to achieve operational capability. Analysts stress that early serial production of the KF-21EX is crucial for ensuring long-term export competitiveness.",

    "title": "Breaking news : Egypt could become second international client of Turkish Kaan fighter jet",
    "content": "The KAAN is T\u00fcrkiye's indigenous fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, designed for air superiority and multirole combat missions, featuring advanced avionics, low observability, and high maneuverability. (Picture source: SSB)\n\nKaan is engineered to match or exceed the capabilities of other fifth-generation platforms such as the American F-35 Lightning II, the Russian Su-57 Felon, and the Chinese J-20 Mighty Dragon. The aircraft incorporates a low-observable airframe with radar-absorbing materials and sharply angled faceted surfaces to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS). The internal weapons bay configuration allows the aircraft to maintain stealth during combat missions, and provisions are being made for conformal fuel tanks to extend operational range while preserving its low observable profile. The aircraft is being designed for multi-domain operations with a digital backbone that supports sensor fusion, cooperative engagement capabilities, and real-time battlefield data integration across allied forces.\n\nOne of the Kaan's key technological highlights is its next-generation active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, developed by ASELSAN, which offers target tracking, electronic attack, and synthetic aperture radar imaging functionalities in a single integrated suite. This radar is coupled with advanced infrared search and track (IRST), distributed aperture systems (DAS), and electro-optical targeting systems (EOTS), enabling the pilot to detect, track, and engage enemy aircraft without relying solely on radar emissions. The cockpit features a panoramic touch display, voice command interface, and helmet-mounted display system (HMDS), allowing for maximum pilot situational awareness and reduced workload during high-intensity engagements.\n\nThe twin-engine configuration of Kaan is initially powered by General Electric F110-GE-129 engines, pending the future integration of a domestically developed powerplant under a parallel engine development program led by TRMotor and T\u00dcB\u0130TAK-SAGE. Each engine delivers more than 29,000 pounds of thrust, enabling sustained supersonic speeds (supercruise) above Mach 1.8 without the use of afterburners, a critical requirement for survivability in peer-level conflicts. The platform is expected to have a combat radius exceeding 1,100 kilometers and a service ceiling above 55,000 feet. With a maximum takeoff weight of approximately 27,000 kg, Kaan is designed to carry an internal payload of up to 1,500 kg in its weapons bays and an external payload of over 6,000 kg under its wings when stealth is not required.\n\nKaan's modular architecture supports a broad spectrum of air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions, including the G\u00f6kdo\u011fan and Bozdo\u011fan indigenous missiles, precision-guided bombs, anti-ship missiles, and stand-off cruise weapons like SOM-J. Electronic warfare pods, jamming systems, and satellite communications suites are also planned as optional integrations to adapt the aircraft for specialized roles, such as suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) and strategic strike missions. Beyond its technical attributes, the fighter is being built with artificial intelligence-driven mission systems, predictive maintenance capabilities, and secure datalink interoperability for NATO and non-NATO coalition operations.\n\nAs part of its international outreach and growing defense export ambitions, T\u00fcrkiye has previously reached a preliminary agreement with Indonesia for the future sale of Kaan fighter jets. The deal, still in its early stages, includes potential joint development opportunities and technology transfer, reflecting both nations' shared interest in enhancing their indigenous defense capabilities. Indonesia, which has long sought to modernize its air force beyond Russian and Western platforms, views the Kaan as a strategic alternative that balances cost, capability, and industrial collaboration. While no finalized contract has been disclosed, officials from both sides have signaled strong intent to move forward, positioning Indonesia as one of the first potential foreign operators of T\u00fcrkiye's fifth-generation combat aircraft.\n\nThe geopolitical relevance of this collaboration between Egypt and T\u00fcrkiye lies in its potential to reshape regional power dynamics at a time when Middle Eastern and North African defense strategies are undergoing significant transformation. Both nations have faced varying degrees of restriction and political complications in acquiring advanced Western defense systems. T\u00fcrkiye was excluded from the U.S. F-35 program over its acquisition of the Russian S-400 system, while Egypt has faced delays and limitations in receiving Western platforms, particularly from the United States and Europe, due to human rights and foreign policy concerns. By engaging in indigenous development of a fifth-generation fighter, Egypt and T\u00fcrkiye are asserting greater defense autonomy and technological sovereignty.\n\nThis move also reflects a broader strategic convergence between Ankara and Cairo, whose relations have gradually normalized after a decade of estrangement following the 2013 political transition in Egypt. Their alignment on a high-stakes military-industrial project indicates a shared understanding that the regional balance of power is increasingly influenced by indigenous capabilities, especially in airpower, unmanned systems, and precision strike technologies. It also sends a clear signal to traditional regional rivals such as Israel, Iran, and the Gulf states, that a new axis of military-industrial cooperation is forming, potentially challenging the monopoly on fifth-generation combat air systems in the region.\n\nFurthermore, Egypt's involvement in the Kaan program could have long-term implications for defense industrial development across Africa. If Egypt secures domestic assembly and manufacturing rights, it would become the first African country to co-produce a fifth-generation fighter jet, elevating its status as a regional defense hub. This could lead to broader defense export opportunities on the continent and strengthen Egypt's geopolitical clout within the African Union and Arab League. For T\u00fcrkiye, Egypt's entry offers an opportunity to share the program's financial and logistical burden while increasing the aircraft's attractiveness on the global market through a co-development model.",

    "content": "US-based propulsion system manufacturer Beehive Industries has unveiled the Rampart engine, a fully 3D printed propulsion system developed for use within the Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) framework. Nicknamed \"The Force Multiplier,\" the engine is specifically designed for uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) intended to operate alongside manned fighter aircraft in high-threat environments. It supports a broad set of mission profiles, including strike operations, intelligence and surveillance, decoy deployment, and logistics support.\n\nRampart's role is to expand the operational flexibility of air forces by enabling UAVs to assume missions that may carry higher levels of risk or complexity. In doing so, it aims to reduce the burden on crewed assets and contribute to more adaptable and distributed force structures.\n\nDesign, Manufacturing, and Operational Capabilities\n\nRampart is manufactured using additive techniques, eliminating the need for traditional processes such as casting, tooling, and the sourcing of long-lead-time components. This digital-first approach is intended to streamline production, reduce costs, and enable faster response to shifting operational demands. The manufacturing model also enhances supply chain flexibility by reducing reliance on complex or outsourced parts.\n\nThe engine is built to deliver consistent performance across a wide range of demanding conditions. It offers extended operational range and endurance, enabling UAVs to travel farther and remain in the air longer. Its thrust capabilities support the carriage of mission-specific payloads, such as advanced sensors, decoy systems, or logistical equipment. Durability is a central design feature; Rampart-powered UAVs are constructed to remain functional even after exposure to hostile fire or adverse environments.\n\nRampart is produced entirely within the United States, reinforcing domestic control over critical propulsion technologies. This approach is intended to strengthen national defense infrastructure by improving supply chain security and reducing dependency on foreign manufacturing for key components.\n\nExpanding 3D Printing's Role in UAV Development\n\nBeyond Beehive Industries, several other organizations are integrating 3D printing into their unmanned aerial vehicle programs. Recently, it was announced that the 432nd Wing at Creech Air Force Base (AFB) has integrated Bambu Lab X1 Carbon FDM 3D printers into MQ-9 Reaper maintenance training. This allows on-site production of spare parts, reducing costs (e.g., a $10,000 part now costs $15) and minimizing downtime. As a result, maintenance crews can train more effectively, and keeping UCAVs operational without relying as much on external supply chains, making repairs faster and more efficient.\n\nElsewhere, Firestorm Labs secured a five-year, $100 million Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) from USAF to develop and supply modular unmanned aerial systems (UAS). The agreement enables the Air Force to issue multiple orders over five years, with performance extending up to 24 months after the final order.\n\nSpecializing in Group 1-3 UAS for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), and tactical support, Firestorm is leveraging 3D printing to enable rapid, localized production of drone components. This approach is said to reduce reliance on centralized factories and improve adaptability in contested environments.\n\nWhile you're here, why not subscribe to our YouTube channel?

    "title": "After Russia, US company replicates Iran's drones - but their design dates back to the 1980s in Germany | Matthias Monroy",
    "content": "Some rival states are currently building visually similar flying wing kamikaze drones. The origins of the technology lie in a development by Dornier in the 1980s. Initially, only Israel pursued the concept further.\n\nA US company has presented the Low-Cost Unmanned Combat Attack System (LUCAS), a new cost-effective wing-only drone that was developed to compete with the Iranian Shahed 136. The system developed by SpektreWorks is visually very similar to the well-known Kamikaze drone: both have a triangular delta wing shape and a piston engine for the propeller drive.\n\nThe LUCAS concept has a take-off weight of 70 to 100 kg and flies at altitudes of up to 5,500 metres. Like the Shahed, it supports rapid take-off from lorry platforms and, like the Iranian mini combat drone, is to be deployed in large numbers - each unit reportedly costs around 100,000 US dollars. It is a disposable weapon: the aircraft is also destroyed by the impact and explosion of the warhead it is carrying.\n\n700 kamikaze drones in one night\n\nThe Shahed drones became known during the Ukraine war through deliveries from Iran to Russia and through replicas made there. These Russian Geran-2s now systematically attack civilian infrastructure and residential areas in Ukraine in nightly swarms. Russia has increased the number of attacks from around 200 per week to over 1,000 over the past year - last 8 July, over 700 drones were even deployed in a single night.\n\nRussia initially began deploying the Shahed-136 with direct imports from Iran. The first documented deliveries took place in September 2022. Tehran initially denied the sale and later claimed that the transactions had already taken place before the Russian attack on Ukraine. The Russian replicas are now being manufactured in its own factories - according to reports, the country is currently able to produce 1,000 Geran-2s per month.\n\nRussia is now working on modernising the delta wing aircraft. This is said to include a variant powered by a jet engine and therefore significantly faster - it has reportedly already been deployed and is based on a successor to the Shahed-136. Future models are to be controlled via SIM cards or Russian satellite internet in order to prevent interference with radio communications from the Ukrainian military.\n\nAdvanced Drone Anti-Radar\n\nThe roots of the crewless flying wing revolution actually lie in Germany in the 1980s. At that time, the German army and the USA had launched a project to develop a drone capable of attacking Soviet radar installations. The German aircraft manufacturer Dornier developed the 110-kilogram Drone Anti-Radar (DAR) with a range of around 600 kilometres. It was to be launched from special lorries, each of which could transport six weapon systems.\n\nThe DAR was technologically advanced for its time. It was able to recognise enemy radar missions and autonomously dive into a target - making it a forerunner of today's popular kamikaze drones. Unlike the Shahed, however, no targets could be programmed into the DAR. The similarities therefore relate more to the design than the electronics, which have made disruptive leaps in the past 40 years, including AI systems.\n\nThe DAR was to be put into service with the Bundeswehr in the 1990s. However, the project was cancelled at the end of the Cold War. The story of the deadly flying wing did not end there: the state-owned Israeli company IAI took over the concept and used it to develop the Harpy drone, which is still successful today and, like its successor model Harop, is still manufactured and exported.\n\nIn the meantime, the German Armed Forces had also rekindled their plans for kamikaze drones: similar to the DAR, the Bundeswehr developed the so-called Effective System for Standoff Control in the Area of Operations (WABEP) together with Rheinmetall in the decade. However, it was to consist of two systems: The small \"Target Tracking\" (KZO) drone, which was already in service with the army, was to detect targets, which would then be engaged by a kamikaze drone from Israel's defence contractor IAI.\n\nGerman army catches up on development\n\nAccording to the 2009 Bundeswehr plan, the Ministry of Defence wanted to procure two WABEP systems, each with 42 drones plus ground stations. The system was successfully tested but not further developed, as the Bundeswehr only planned to put it into service in 2019 and considered this date to be too late - a mistake, as became apparent in the war for Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020 at the latest, where Israeli kamikaze drones are said to have supported the Azerbaijani offensive extremely successfully.\n\nNow the German army wants to catch up on the development, and tests of drones from German manufacturers are being carried out in the Ukraine war before procurement decisions are made. The Munich-based AI company Helsing has announced that, following an initial order for over 4,000 small kamikaze drones, it will deliver a further 6,000 units of its electronically powered HX-2 to the Ukrainian military - they are to be controllable by individual soldiers in a swarm.\n\nMunich-based competitor Quantum Systems is also stepping up its military involvement in Ukraine and doubling its production capacity for reconnaissance drones in 2025. Quantum company boss Florian Seibel also founded a company called Stark for kamikaze drones, which is to produce in Ukraine. Donaustahl instead produces small warheads for to be mounted on any quadrocopter by Ukrainian units. The Lower Bavarian company also recently presented its own vertical take-off kamikaze drone for use in Ukraine.",

This fully modular suite has been designed to adapt to the specific needs of each army.\n\nThe solution also integrates the most common consumable countermeasure systems, such as CFD (Chaff and Flare Dispenser) dispensers for flares, used to confuse heat-seeking missiles, and chaff, which releases small reflective fibres capable of disorienting radio-frequency guided missiles.\n\nIndra has equipped fighter jets such as the F18, military transport aircraft such as the A400M and C295, and helicopters such as the NH90 and Tiger with its warning and self-protection systems. It is also one of the key companies in the development of the Eurofighter's self-protection system.\n\nWith the evolution of these systems, Indra is enabling all these platforms to continue operating at the highest level in the coming decades, when new and increasingly complex threats will emerge. The company also leads or participates in several key European R&D projects working on cutting-edge technologies for aircraft, such as multifunction systems that combine radar, communications and electronic warfare in a single device (CROWN and SCEPTER), electronic attack capabilities (REACT and REACT II) and self-protection systems for aircraft and helicopters, which will incorporate the use of AI (CARMENTA and CARMENTA FP).",

    "content": "US President Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs and penalties on India is expected to rebound on American defence firms bidding for multi-billion-dollar projects in India, sources said.\n\nFor now, New Delhi is holding off on approving any major defence deals with the US until tempers cool, they added.\n\nBarring a few exceptions, most military procurement projects -- including fighter jets, transport aircraft, specialised vehicles and anti-tank systems -- fall under the 'Make in India' initiative. This means any US company securing a contract must partner with an Indian firm and establish manufacturing facilities locally, marking a strategic shift in India's defence acquisition policy.\n\nMinistry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal stated, \"We have a strong defence partnership with the US, which has been strengthening over the last several years.\" He added that the relationship has potential to grow further under the India-US 'COMPACT' arrangement for the 21st century.\n\nCOMPACT -- Catalysing Opportunities for Military Partnership, Accelerated Commerce and Technology -- was announced in February following a meeting between President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nAmong the major deals in the pipeline is India's procurement of six additional Boeing P-8I long-range maritime surveillance aircraft. These aircraft, capable of anti-submarine warfare, were officially confirmed during the Modi-Trump meeting. A joint statement noted that terms for the P-8I deal were agreed upon and the contract is nearing finalisation.\n\nIndia had earlier procured 12 P-8I aircraft, and the US State Department cleared the additional sale in May 2021. The P-8I platform was used to monitor the LAC during the military standoff with China.\n\nAnother significant American offering is the Stryker armoured fighting vehicle. India is exploring variants with amphibious capabilities and integration of the Javelin anti-tank missile. A demonstration for the Indian Army is expected this year. The Army has projected a need for a large number of wheeled armoured fighting vehicles. The US has proposed setting up a global manufacturing base for the Stryker in India.\n\nTalks are also underway to co-produce the Javelin missile in India. A long-term agreement is being negotiated, with Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) having signed a memorandum with Raytheon and Lockheed Martin to explore joint manufacturing opportunities.\n\nThe largest potential deal on the table is the Indian Air Force's tender to procure and manufacture 114 multi-role fighter jets. US giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin have expressed interest -- a deal that would require shifting production lines to India and involve billions of dollars in investment and revenue.\n\nIn another joint venture, Lockheed Martin and Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) are bidding to manufacture 80 C-130J special operations aircraft in India. The IAF currently operates a fleet of 12 such aircraft. A dedicated 'Tata Lockheed Martin Aerostructures Limited' facility in Hyderabad already manufactures parts for the global C-130J supply chain.\n\nAs for rotary-wing platforms, the Indian Army has the option to procure 11 more Apache AH-64E attack helicopters, while the IAF is seeking additional Chinook heavy-lift helicopters -- both manufactured by Boeing.",

    "title": "MoD Sets Record Green-Lighting $18.5\u202fBillion in Defence Procurement Deals",
    "content": "MoD Sets Record Green-Lighting $18.5\u202fBillion in Defence Procurement Deals Friday, August 01, 2025 by Indian Defence News\n\nIndia's Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), led by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, made a decision to approve significant capital acquisition proposals worth \u20b954,000 crore ($6.51 billion), which are planned to modernise and elevate India's defence capabilities.\n\nIt also powers the Government's long-term initiative of promoting local defence production to bring advanced technology to all three defence services.\n\nThis \u20b954,000\u202fcrore tranche approved in March\u202f2025 is one of the largest Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) approvals to date for a single batch of proposals. Previous notable DAC approvals include \u20b921,772\u202fcrore in December 2024 for naval vessels (surface ships, helicopters)\u202f and \u20b938,900\u202fcrore in July 2020 covering diverse equipment under the Atmanirbhar push\u202f.\n\nSo, this March batch ranks among the top two single\u2011session green\u2011lights, second only to the \u20b91.05\u202flakh\u202fcrore \"Buy Indian\u2011IDDM\" approval in July\u202f2025.\n\nCombined, these two tranches account for a staggering \u20b91.59\u202flakh crore ($18.5\u202fbillion) in fresh defence acquisition clearances this year alone. The March approvals focused heavily on indigenisation, including 1,350 HP engines for T-90 tanks, Varunastra heavyweight torpedoes, and advanced Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) aircraft systems.\n\nThe latest July approvals have further pushed that trend. The latest batch of programs green-lit under the 3 July approval of Indian-Indigenously Designed, Developed, and Manufactured systems includes Armoured Recovery Vehicles, Electronic Warfare Systems, Integrated Common Inventory Management Systems for the Tri-Services, and Surface-to-Air Missiles, along with moored mines, mine-countermeasure vessels, autonomous underwater platforms, and upgraded naval gun mounts.\n\nThese projects will not only strengthen India's operational capabilities but also drive greater self-reliance in critical technologies, such as logistics digitization, electronic warfare, and advanced air defence.\n\nFollowing approval from the DAC, the Indian Army will receive 1,350 HP engines to modernize its T-90 tanks engines. This represents a 35% increase in power over the previously used Russian V\u201192S2 diesel engine, producing 1,000\u202fHP.\n\nIndia's operational readiness in challenging terrains will benefit substantially from this advancement because it improves the T-90 tank's power-to-weight ratio and mobility(especially in high-altitude, low-oxygen situations like Ladakh), enhancing strategic flexibility and speed of manoeuvre.\n\nThe Indian Navy is set to receive Varunastra anti-submarine torpedoes designed by the Naval Science and Technology Laboratory. The Varunastra is a heavyweight, electrically powered, wire-guided plus acoustic\u2011homing torpedo developed by DRDO's NSTL and manufactured by BDL.\n\nIt can achieve a speed of 40-50\u202fkn (74-93\u202fkm/h) and has a range of 40-50\u202fkm. It's India's first indigenous heavyweight ASW torpedo with >95% local content, offering enhanced targeting accuracy, depth coverage, target tracking in noisy environments, and reduced dependency on imports.\n\nAnother system green-lit for the Indian Navy are Airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft systems remain the preferred acquisition choice for the Indian Air Force to boost their aerial surveillance and combat capabilities.\n\nThe DAC green-light included six Embraer ERJ\u2011145 aircraft fitted with DRDO's Indigenous Netra AEW&C (Mk\u20111A variant) for the IAF, plus six Mk\u20112 AEW&C systems based on second-hand Airbus A\u2011321 airframes sourced from Air India. This provides a mix of medium and larger AEW&C platforms to improve India's aerial surveillance and command capabilities.\n\nNew Guidelines Mean Faster Procurements\n\nA new set of guidelines approved by the DAC aims to reduce the time capital procurement processes take. The Defence Ministry adopted the move under the 'Year of Reforms' initiative aimed at simplifying the acquisition processes and making them more effective and transparent.\n\nIndia performs defence infrastructure development according to the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' initiative aimed at promoting locally manufactured products and lowering material imports from abroad. The government directs its investments to create military technology domestically to protect national security while simultaneously developing the defence sector and generating new employment opportunities.\n\nBy 2025-26, India aims to reach Defence production of \u20b91.60 lakh crore ($18.7 billion) focusing on advanced capabilities such as observation technologies and artificial intelligence systems. The Indian defence sector aims to build international business ventures worth $3.52 billion through increased defence export revenue exceeding \u20b930,000 crore.\n\nNew Helicopters Funded\n\nIn addition to the projects green-lit by DAC in Spring, the Indian Ministry of Defence also signed two important contracts worth a further \u20b964,148.39 Crores with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) to obtain 156 Prachand Light Combat Helicopters (LCH). The company will provide 66 aircraft to the IAF and 90 helicopters to the Indian Army, this is an acquisition strategy designed to boost the military capabilities of both forces while strengthening India's self-reliance in defence production.\n\nThe Prachand deal is not part of the \u20b954,000\u202fcrore DAC package, and it stands as another major procurement initiative. The \u20b962,700\u202fcrore contract for 156 Prachand helicopters (66 for IAF and 90 for Army), approved by the Cabinet Committee on Security in March\u202f2025, is separate from the March DAC approvals.\n\nPrachand combat helicopter is India's first indigenous aircraft that operates successfully above elevations of 5,000 meters. Engineers plan to boost the use of domestic components for the helicopters to above 65%. The stealth capabilities of the helicopter enhance its combat survivability because of its narrow design, along with diminished radar visibility. The helicopter combines infrared suppression technologies with tornado-resistant landing gear, which compensates for its armour protection.\n\nThe Prachand helicopter is 15.8 meters in length and 4.7 meters tall, but still maintains powerful performance for optimal maneuverability. An advanced hingeless main rotor and bearingless tail rotor system fitted on the helicopter delivers great agility alongside precise control for high-speed mission operations. Its quick climbing abilities, along with its sharp turning capability, give the helicopter optimal performance in urban warfare and mountainous environments. Prachand obtains superior endurance for combat missions because it incorporates two indigenous Shakti turboshaft engines to power its operations.\n\nThe Helicopter extends its operational capabilities through its ability to undertake mid-air refuelling sessions. The Prachand provides the defence forces of India with powerful aerial warfare capabilities because it combines multi-role functionality with excellent maneuverability features, along with its advanced avionics system. The defence manufacturing industry of India will see significant growth through this project by using 250 local companies, mainly Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), and creating more than 8,500 direct employment opportunities and supporting jobs.\n\nNew Air-To-Air Refuelling Capability\n\nIn addition to the LCH deal the Ministry of Defence signed agreements with Metrea Management to get a Flight Refuelling Aircraft (FRA) through a wet lease - providing aircraft and support. This FRA wet lease is not a completely new capability for India because the IAF already operates aerial refuelling tankers (Il-78MKI).\n\nIt's a temporary enhancement to strengthen refuelling capability and provide training while India decides on new tankers to replace the older Il-78s. Indian Air Force pilots, together with Indian Navy pilots, will receive air-refuelling instruction through this program. Metrea has agreed to provide a KC-135 aircraft within six months, according to the terms of the first FRA wet lease for the Indian Air Force.\n\nThe initiative improves military readiness through training capabilities and operational preparedness, thus enhancing the aerial support capabilities for fighter jets, together with all aircraft in Indian service. This procurement agreement represents a major achievement for Indian defence acquisition because it ranks as one of the biggest deals for locally manufactured military equipment and demonstrates India's dedication to automotive defence production and improved military capabilities.\n\nThree new defence contracts bring the Ministry of Defence to a total of 193 agreements in the 2024-25 financial year, with a combined value of \u20b92,09,050 crore ($24.59 billion).\n\nThe new defence procurement value now represents the highest total defence expenditure in India's history, surpassing the former record by nearly double. Indian defence companies secured 177 contracts, which made up 92% of all contracts and surpassed the \u20b91,68,922 crore (81%) of total contract value. The defence industry has achieved new heights in Indian defence capabilities because of national initiatives focused on defence self-sufficiency and native military hardware advancement.\n\nBased On AFT Report\n\nComments",

    "title": "Chinese Engineers Claim \"Our Drones Survive Almost Nine Out Of Ten Missile Attacks With Cutting-Edge Tech\" - Visegr\u00e1d Post",
    "content": "Illustration of drones equipped with rocket boosters for evasive maneuvering against missile attacks.\n\nA new technological advancement in drone warfare has emerged from China, promising to significantly enhance the survivability of combat drones on the battlefield. Researchers have developed an evasive maneuvering system that can reportedly increase a drone's ability to evade missile attacks to nearly 90 percent. This innovation involves the installation of lightweight rocket boosters on drones, which enable them to perform high-speed, abrupt maneuvers. Despite potential trade-offs in weight and power, this technology could make drones deadlier and more resilient, marking a substantial leap forward in military strategy and defense systems.\n\nThe core of this new technology lies in its unpredictability. Dubbed the \"terminal evasion\" system, the concept involves rocket boosters that allow drones to make sudden course changes, effectively dodging even the most advanced tracking missiles. According to the South China Morning Post, the system was rigorously tested through digital simulations, showcasing a significant improvement in drone survival rates. The researchers propose that these last-minute evasions would cause missiles to detonate harmlessly in mid-air, thus avoiding damage to the drone.\n\nThis advancement comes in stark contrast to the current survival rates of drones in conflict zones like Ukraine, where only 10 percent manage to evade destruction. The Chinese engineers' system promises to elevate this survival rate to a staggering 87 percent. The emphasis on last-moment evasive actions is crucial, as it minimizes the missile's ability to adjust its trajectory, ensuring the drone's safety even in hostile environments.\n\nThe Sky Is No Longer Safe: Anti-Drone Shields Are Rising and Military Officials Claim \"It's a Turning Point in Modern Warfare\"\n\nDrones have become an integral part of modern military operations, despite their vulnerability to air defense systems. Ukrainian military officials have highlighted the lethal impact of drones, stating they are responsible for more casualties than other weapons. Additionally, reports indicate that Russia is acquiring vast numbers of drones monthly. The proposed evasive system could further enhance the strategic value of drones, making them even more effective on the battlefield.\n\nDeveloped under the leadership of Bi Wenhao at Northwestern Polytechnical University, the system is founded on principles of precise timing, directional intelligence, and thrust. The boosters must activate just seconds before potential missile impact, providing the necessary window for evasion. Moreover, the system's ability to rapidly assess and react to the drone's surroundings is critical for its success. Generating up to 16Gs of acceleration, the thrust component ensures a swift, unpredictable shift in the drone's path, complicating the missile's targeting process.\n\nAir Combat Revolution: Elon Musk Calls for Drones to Replace Fighter Jets and Lead the Next Generation of Military Power\n\nDespite the promising capabilities of this new technology, several challenges need to be addressed before it can be widely implemented. Real-world testing remains a significant hurdle, as simulations may not fully capture the complexities of actual combat scenarios. Additionally, the introduction of rocket boosters brings about practical concerns, such as increased weight, reduced battery life, and limited payload capacity.\n\nThe researchers published their findings in the Chinese defense journal Acta Armamentarii, signaling the beginning of further explorations into this innovative technology. As the balance between technological advancement and practical application continues to evolve, the full impact of this system on drone warfare remains to be seen.\n\n\"The Pentagon Is Opening a 'Top Gun' for Killer Drones\" as Ukraine-Style Tactics Trigger Fierce Debate Over AI Warfare and America's Next-Gen Combat Doctrine\n\nThe development of advanced drone evasion technology by Chinese engineers could have far-reaching implications for global military dynamics. As countries around the world continue to invest in drone technology, the ability to effectively counter air defense systems becomes increasingly crucial. This new system could shift the balance of power in conflict zones, prompting other nations to develop similar capabilities.\n\nFurthermore, as the role of drones expands beyond military applications into areas such as surveillance and humanitarian assistance, the need for robust, reliable systems becomes even more essential. The potential for this technology to influence non-military sectors underscores its significance in shaping the future of drone utilization across various fields.\n\nAs advancements in drone technology continue to emerge, the question remains: How will these innovations reshape not only military strategy but also international relations and the future of warfare?",

    "title": "Russia is bringing missiles back. And this time, it's personal - Conservative News & Right Wing News | Gun Laws & Rights News Site",
    "content": "With the US deploying intermediate-range systems in Europe and Asia, Russia says it's done waiting - and begins reshaping its own arsenal\n\nOn August 4, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced that Moscow is abandoning its unilateral moratorium on the deployment of ground-based intermediate- and shorter-range missiles (INF-class). The decision comes amid what Russian officials describe as an ongoing expansion of US missile systems in Europe and the Indo-Pacific, including weapons once banned under the now-defunct INF Treaty.\n\nThe US has begun placing such systems in key regions on a potentially permanent basis, undermining strategic stability and creating a direct threat to Russia's national security. Moscow is preparing military-technical countermeasures in response - and is now lifting all political constraints on the development and deployment of such systems.\n\nRT examines the situation through the lens of leading Russian military experts, who describe the move as long-anticipated, technically overdue, and strategically inevitable. Their assessments shed light on Moscow's doctrinal shift, future deployment options, and the broader geopolitical implications for Europe and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\n\nWhat the Foreign Ministry said: Russia's rationale\n\nMoscow had shown restraint for several years after the US withdrew from the INF Treaty in 2019. Although legally freed from its obligations under the accord, Russia opted for a self-imposed moratorium, vowing not to deploy ground-based intermediate-range missiles unless similar US systems appeared near its borders.\n\nThat condition, the Ministry statement asserts, no longer applies.\n\n\"Since 2023, we have observed instances of US systems capable of ground-launched INF strikes being transferred to the European NATO countries for trial use during exercises that clearly have an anti-Russian slant.\"\n\nIt also pointed to broader US and allied efforts to institutionalize deployments of such missile systems across multiple theaters. Specific examples included:\n\nThe deployment of the Typhon missile launcher to the Philippines under the guise of drills, with the system remaining in place even after exercises concluded;\n\nTests of the PrSM missile in Australia during 2025 exercises - with its future variants projected to exceed 1,000 km in range;\n\nThe planned deployment of SM-6 interceptors in Germany by 2026, launched from the same Typhon system.\n\nRussia views these developments as \"destabilizing missile buildups\" that threaten its national security \"at the strategic level.\" The Foreign Ministry stated that Moscow will now undertake \"military-technical response measures\", with the precise configuration to be determined by the Russian leadership based on inter-agency analysis and the evolving strategic environment.\n\nOfficials also referenced an earlier warning issued in June 2025, when Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said that Russia's moratorium was approaching its \"logical conclusion\" in light of \"sensitive missile threats\" being fielded by the West.\n\nWhile Russia's announcement marks a formal policy shift, experts argue that the conditions for abandoning the moratorium have been building for years - largely due to developments on the US side.\n\nAccording to military analyst Ilya Kramnik, a research fellow at the Center for Strategic Planning Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences, the deployment of INF-class systems by the United States and its allies has made Russia's restraint functionally obsolete.\n\n\"In principle, Russia has long had reason to consider itself free from any INF-related constraints,\" he notes. \"But this week's statement appears to be synchronized with the start of deliveries of the Oreshnik missile system to the armed forces.\"\n\nThe US began laying the groundwork for forward deployment of ground-based missiles as early as 2021, when it launched the formation of Multi-Domain Task Forces (MDTFs) - mobile army units designed to integrate long-range fires, precision strike, and battlefield networking. These units were to be equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles using the Typhon launcher, a land-based containerized system derived from the naval Mk.41 vertical launch platform.\n\n\"The second such group, the 2nd MDTF, was formed in Germany,\" Kramnik explains, \"with a clear orientation toward the European theater.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Typhon has been actively deployed in the Indo-Pacific, most notably to the Philippines, where it arrived during bilateral exercises but was not withdrawn. The US has also resumed tests of the PrSM missile in Australia - a platform that, in its future iterations, is expected to exceed a 1,000-km range, placing it well within INF classification.\n\nPlans for SM-6 missile deployment in Germany by 2026 - also via the Typhon system - further contributed to Russian concerns. Although originally designed as a naval interceptor, the SM-6 has evolved into a multi-role weapon with conventional strike capability.\n\nTaken together, these moves have prompted Russian officials to conclude that the United States is pursuing a strategy of \"sustained forward missile presence\" across both Europe and Asia - effectively restoring the kind of reach that the INF Treaty once prohibited.\n\n\"The military-technical reality has changed,\" says Kramnik. \"The political gesture now simply reflects that shift.\"\n\nA shift in doctrine: Russia's new missile strategy\n\nWith the self-imposed moratorium now lifted, Russia is expected to move rapidly toward expanding its inventory of ground-based intermediate- and shorter-range missile systems. The focus, according to Russian defense experts, will be not only on production but on doctrinal adaptation and forward deployment.\n\nOne of the central components of Russia's future arsenal is the Oreshnik system - a mobile platform widely viewed as the spiritual successor to the Soviet-era Pioneer (SS-20). The weapon was first publicly hinted at in 2023, and serial deliveries to Russian troops were reported to have begun in mid-2025.\n\n\"The moratorium's expiration was long overdue,\" says Vasily Kashin, Director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at HSE University.\n\n\"The very first test of Oreshnik signaled that Russia was moving away from self-imposed limits. Now that move has been formalized - and it must be fully implemented.\"\n\nKashin notes that Soviet missile forces had previously considered positioning Pioneer-class systems in the northeast of the country, including near Anadyr in Chukotka - from where missiles could potentially reach deep into the US mainland, including San Francisco. Modern deployment patterns, however, are likely to prioritize northwestern and southern Russia, given their proximity to NATO territory.\n\nIn addition to Oreshnik, experts expect land-based variants of the Kalibr and Tsirkon missile families to be introduced, along with new ballistic versions of the Iskander system.\n\nWe will likely see a full spectrum of platforms: cruise, ballistic, and hypersonic,\" says Dmitry Stefanovich, co-founder of the Watfor think tank.\n\n\"These systems are already being incorporated into various service branches - not just the Strategic Missile Forces, but also the Ground Forces and the Navy's coastal units.\"\n\nStefanovich adds that Belarus is a likely site for early deployments - and that newly formed missile brigades may emerge across all Russian military districts by the end of 2025.\n\nEurope in the crosshairs: Echoes of the Cold War\n\nThe lifting of Russia's moratorium revives a security dilemma once thought relegated to Cold War history - the deployment of nuclear-capable intermediate-range missiles on the European continent.\n\n\"The current trajectory evokes the Euro-missile crisis of the Cold War,\" says Sergey Oznobishchev, Director of the Institute for Strategic Assessments.\n\n\"Back then, it took years of confrontation before the sides finally reached the INF Treaty. We may see a similar pattern again.\"\n\nUS allies are not merely accepting new deployments - some are actively seeking them. Alongside US systems, European initiatives such as the ELSA program and missile developments in South Korea and Japan are reshaping regional balances.\n\n\"This is no longer just a bilateral arms race,\" Stefanovich notes.\n\n\"We are witnessing a multinational acceleration - with several countries now embracing systems that were once considered too destabilizing.\"\n\nWhile primarily strategic in nature, intermediate-range missiles may also play a role on the battlefield - particularly in Ukraine, experts suggest.\n\n\"We are likely to see more 'combat testing' of such missile systems as part of the special military operation,\" Stefanovich says. \"Their ability to strike deep, fast, and precisely makes them valuable against air defenses and critical infrastructure.\"\n\nHe predicts that Russia will form new multi-role missile formations, including equivalents of the American MDTF, capable of integrating strike systems, air defense, and electronic warfare across all branches - including VDV and Aerospace Forces.\n\n\"We are at the beginning of a multi-directional arms race,\" says Stefanovich.\n\n\"This is a missile renaissance, driven not by ambition but by necessity.\"\n\nAlthough some experts - including Oznobishchev - suggest that a new arms control regime may eventually emerge, the current consensus is clear: restraint has ended, and military-technical competition is accelerating.\n\n\"The global trajectory is clear,\" Stefanovich concludes. \"Deterrence is back - and it's being redefined.\"",

    "title": "Trials of Extended Range Pinaka Launchers Conclude, Rockets To Be Inducted Soon",
    "content": "Trials of Extended Range Pinaka Launchers Conclude, Rockets To Be Inducted Soon Wednesday, August 06, 2025 by Indian Defence News\n\nThe Pinaka Multi-Barrel Rocket Launcher System, a product of Indian indigenous defence technology, has recently achieved a significant milestone with the successful conclusion of trials for its Extended Range (ER) version.\n\nThe ER Pinaka substantially enhances the Indian Army's artillery capabilities, providing both increased range and precision for battlefield operations.\n\nOriginally, the Pinaka rockets were capable of striking targets up to 37km away, but the latest advancements have doubled this range to approximately 75km. This enhanced reach enables the system to support deep-fire missions and long-range suppression of enemy positions, substantially expanding operational flexibility.\n\nAccuracy has also seen a quantum leap: the new GPS-guided rockets, supported by an onboard computer, are capable of striking within a 25-metre radius of their intended target. This precision, combined with a comparatively large warhead, renders the ER Pinaka extremely lethal against both concentrated and dispersed adversary formations.\n\nThe navigation and targeting systems constitute significant upgrades. The ER Pinaka is equipped with both a Global Positioning System (GPS) and an Inertial Navigation System (INS). Together, these systems allow for programmable trajectories and targets prior to launch. In the event that the rocket strays from its set course, the onboard computer uses GPS to correct its path.\n\nShould GPS be unavailable due to jamming or interference, the INS ensures the projectile still reaches its designated target, maintaining mission reliability under electronic warfare conditions.\n\nEach Pinaka battery consists of six launchers, and every launcher is fitted with 12 tubes, allowing for a total salvo of 72 rockets per battery. These can be launched in a rapid timeframe of just 44 seconds, essentially saturating a designated enemy area of up to 1,000,800 square metres in a single strike. Post-firing, the highly mobile nature of each launcher allows for rapid displacement and repositioning, enhancing survivability and sustaining operational tempo.\n\nAmmunition has also been diversified and modernised. The Indian Army has inducted Area Denial Munition (ADM) Type-1 (DPICM) and High Explosive Pre-Fragmented (HEPF) Mk-1 (Enhanced) rockets for the Pinaka system. These munitions provide specialised effects such as fragmentation and area saturation, making the Pinaka one of the most versatile and effective multiple launch rocket systems in service.\n\nIn terms of force structure, the Indian Army is preparing for a substantial increase in Pinaka-equipped units. At present, there are four regiments operational, but plans are underway to expand this figure to ten regiments within the next two years.\n\nThis expansion is being achieved by converting existing 120mm mortar light regiments into Pinaka regiments, rather than constituting entirely new units. Two regiments have already undergone this conversion, with two more scheduled for this year, expediting the process and optimising the use of existing personnel and assets.\n\nHistorically, the Indian Army's rocket artillery relied on Russian systems such as the Grad and Smerch, but the homegrown Pinaka system has markedly improved indigenous capabilities, reducing dependence on foreign suppliers and increasing battlefield self-reliance.\n\nWith the extended-range variant now entering service, the Pinaka MLRS stands as a testament to India's growing technological prowess in indigenous defence systems and a formidable asset within the Army's long-range strike arsenal.\n\nBased On India Today Report\n\nComments",

These include air-launched versions to be integrated with the IAF's Su-30MKI fighter jets, enhancing their deep strike capabilities, and new ship-based BrahMos units for the Navy's Veer-class warships, significantly boosting maritime strike power.\n\nAdditionally, ground-launched BrahMos systems will continue to be developed and procured to provide multi-front operational flexibility.\n\nThe BrahMos missile system is regarded as one of the fastest supersonic cruise missiles globally, capable of speeds up to Mach 3, and highly resistant to interception by current air defence technologies in Pakistan and China.\n\nIts \"fire-and-forget\" capability, low radar cross-section, and high impact precision make it a technological force multiplier on the battlefield. The recent operational deployment during Operation Sindoor marked BrahMos's first confirmed combat usage, emphasising its strategic importance in India's deterrence doctrine and rapid response framework.\n\nThe post-Operation Sindoor procurement drive reflects a decisive strategic upgrade of India's missile arsenal, reinforcing sovereign defence capabilities under the Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) initiative, and signalling India's readiness to respond sharply to future provocations.\n\nBased On A News18 Report\n\nComments",

    "content": "Indian Army Releases RFI For procurement of Air Defence Fire Control Radar-Drone Detector (ADFCR-DD) Wednesday, August 06, 2025 by Indian Defence News\n\nThe Indian Army has issued a Request for Information (RFI) for the procurement of an Air Defence Fire Control Radar specifically designed as a Drone Detector (ADFCR-DD). This system is intended to strengthen the Indian Army's capability to detect, track, and engage various aerial threats including fighter aircraft, helicopters, and increasingly prevalent hostile drones.\n\nThe ADFCR-DD forms a crucial part of the Ground Based Air Defence system that offers effective short and very short-range point defence in all weather conditions, day and night.\n\nThe radar system comprises several integrated subsystems mounted on a single High Mobility Vehicle, allowing for rapid deployment and mobility. Core components include an X-Band Active Array Antenna-based 3D-Search Radar for airspace surveillance, a Ka-Band Tracking Radar for target tracking, Electro-Optical Sensors for passive 2D tracking, and a Laser Range Finder (LRF) for radar-independent ranging. A Gun Control Unit and power supply system are also integral parts, enabling the system to simultaneously control at least two L-70 anti-aircraft guns and transmit targeting data to very short-range air defence units.\n\nThis radar can search designated airspace, detect and classify aerial targets, perform threat evaluation, and assign and control fire on air defence guns to neutralise threats. It functions effectively up to a minimum tracking range of 12 kilometres, capable of operating in diverse terrains such as plains, deserts, coastal areas, and high-altitude zones up to approximately 4,500 meters.\n\nIt can handle up to 16 targets simultaneously, including fighter jets, attack helicopters, and various Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The system is designed for high accuracy and resilience to electronic countermeasures (ECM), also capable of detecting enemy jammers to enable counteraction.\n\nThe procurement under the \"Buy (Indian-Indigenously Designed Developed and Manufactured)\" category ensures a minimum of 70% indigenous content, aligning with the Indian government's Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative to boost self-reliance in defence technologies. The system described is part of a broader push to modernise and augment India's air defence capabilities, especially to counter the rising threat from drones seen in recent conflicts like Operation Sindoor, where over 600 Pakistani drones were reportedly neutralised by the Indian Army.\n\nIn addition to the radar's detection and fire control capabilities, the Indian Army's RFI emphasises that the radar should be lightweight for mounting on a single vehicle and capable of transmitting data to connected air defence platforms for enhanced networked operations.\n\nElectro-optical fire control systems embedded in the radar enhance day and night targeting precision, providing a robust solution against multiple forms of aerial threats in modern warfare environments.\n\nFurthermore, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is concurrently developing advanced variants of the ADFCR system integrating Directed Energy Weapons (DEWs) and laser-based counter-drone technologies, representing the future evolution of such systems for layered air defence.\n\nThe ADFCR-DD procurement aims to significantly improve the Indian Army's operational readiness against evolving aerial threats, particularly hostile drone incursions, by providing a modern, mobile, and highly integrated fire control radar system with substantial indigenous content and advanced technological capabilities.\n\nIDN\n\nComments",

    "content": "Can A Modern Fighter Jet Survive A Hypersonic Missile Strike? Wednesday, August 06, 2025 by Indian Defence News\n\nNo modern fighter jet can reliably survive a direct hypersonic missile strike under current technological conditions. Hypersonic missiles, defined by their speeds above Mach 5 -- often exceeding Mach 8 (more than 9,800 km/h) -- combine extreme velocity with high manoeuvrability within the atmosphere, allowing them to dramatically change course mid-flight and evade conventional interception methods.\n\nThese characteristics create a nearly insurmountable challenge for current fighter jets and air defence systems.\n\nFrom the moment a hypersonic missile is launched, it gives almost no warning to its target: it can cross hundreds of kilometres within minutes, giving pilots and ground controllers only a few seconds -- if any -- to react.\n\nBecause these missiles can manoeuvre unpredictably, common airborne countermeasures such as flares, electronic jamming, or out-manoeuvring are largely ineffective. Additionally, hypersonic missiles generate a plasma cloud during flight, absorbing radar waves and making them extremely difficult to detect until they are dangerously close.\n\nEven the most advanced fighter jets typically only receive missile warning with seconds to spare, and unless connected to persistent, real-time satellite or networked sensor data, have virtually no time to take evasive action.\n\nEfforts to counter hypersonic threats are underway, including the development of multi-layered defence systems that use advanced radar, kinetic interceptors, and potentially directed energy weapons such as lasers.\n\nHowever, none of these technologies are mature enough to offer reliable protection for individual fighter jets against a hypersonic attack. Recent advances focus on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time threat tracking and proposing potential laser-based defences, but operational deployment is several years away at best.\n\nAir forces are shifting tactics by investing in networked sensor arrays, rapid data transmission, and AI-based threat assessment to at least improve detection and warning times.\n\nThere is interest in eventually equipping aircraft with onboard hypersonic weapons for both offence and defence, but this remains a prospect for future generations of fighters and requires breakthroughs in guidance, detection, and miniaturisation technologies.\n\nUnder present and near-future technological constraints, no fighter jet is considered \"safe\" from a modern hypersonic missile strike once it has been targeted and fired upon.\n\nThe lethality and evasive potential of these weapons represent a transformative challenge in air combat and demand new approaches in detection, tracking, rapid defence escalation, and possibly entirely new forms of aerial warfare technology.\n\nBased On WION Report\n\nComments",

    "title": "Shiva's Bow Goes Digital: How Pinaka Rockets Blend Ancient Power with AI Precision",
    "content": "Pinaka Rockets Blend Ancient Power with AI Precision/FilePicIndia's indigenous Pinaka rocket system is evolving fast, with the upcoming Mk-II boosting strike range to 120 km and Mk-IV reaching 300 km by 2030, combining rapid-fire power, AI-guidance and modular versatility for future warfare.&nbsp;\n\nIndia's artillery capabilities are set for a major transformation with the upcoming induction of advanced Pinaka rocket systems. The Pinaka Mk-II, scheduled to join the Indian Army within three years, will significantly extend India's strike range to 120 km nearly double that of current versions. Looking further ahead, the Pinaka Mk-IV promises even greater capabilities with its impressive 300 km range expected to enter service by 2030.\n\nBuilding on a Strong Foundation\n\nThe Pinaka system, named after Lord Shiva's legendary bow, has already proven its worth with existing variants. The current Pinaka Mk-I covers 38-40 km, while the Extended Range Mk-I reaches 60-75 km. These systems are actively deployed along India's borders, filling a crucial gap between conventional artillery (30 km range) and tactical ballistic missiles (150-300 km range).\n\nPinaka Mk-II: Precision Meets Power\n\nThe upcoming Mk-II represents a significant technological leap. Its 120 km range is achieved through improved rocket fuel, lighter construction, and enhanced guidance systems. The integration of GPS and INS navigation will deliver unprecedented accuracy -- hitting targets within 10 meters compared to the less precise unguided rockets of earlier versions.\n\nThe system retains Pinaka's signature rapid-fire capability, launching 12 rockets in under 44 seconds from a single launcher. A complete regiment with 18 launchers can saturate an area equivalent to 112 football fields, creating devastating firepower concentration.\n\nPinaka Mk-IV: Quasi-Ballistic Missile Technology\n\nThe Mk-IV pushes boundaries further, entering quasi-ballistic missile territory with its 300 km range. This positions it alongside world-class systems like Russia's BM-30 Smerch and China's PHL-03. Its enhanced capabilities include a wider body (potentially expanding from 214mm to 300mm) to accommodate more powerful payloads.\n\nAdvanced guidance systems will combine GPS/INS with active radar seekers for terminal-phase accuracy. The rocket will achieve remarkable precision, landing within 5 meters of targets -- even moving ones like mobile missile launchers. The expected throttleable propulsion system will enable mid-flight trajectory corrections and enhanced maneuverability to evade enemy air defenses.\n\nVersatility Through Modular Design\n\nThe Mk-IV's modular platform approach allows mission-specific configurations. It can deploy cluster munitions for area coverage, anti-radiation warheads targeting enemy radars, or loitering munitions that act as airborne sentinels seeking targets. This flexibility ensures effectiveness across diverse battlefield scenarios.\n\nIntegration and Network-Centric Warfare\n\nConnection to India's Integrated Artillery Command and Control System (IACCS) will enable real-time coordination with other modern systems like the K9 Vajra self-propelled guns and Dhanush howitzers. This network-centric approach transforms individual weapon systems into components of a unified, intelligent warfare ecosystem.\n\nRecent Ammunition Enhancements\n\nThe system's versatility is further enhanced by new ammunition types. The Area Denial Munition (ADM) Type-1 DPICM spreads multiple bomblets over wide areas, effectively blocking enemy movement. The High Explosive Pre-Fragmented (HEPF) Mk-1 Enhanced delivers concentrated destructive power through metal fragments, ideal for eliminating specific targets.\n\nTimeline and Strategic Impact\n\nDevelopment milestones are clearly defined. Mk-IV prototype testing begins in 2027-2028, with production starting in 2029 and full Army induction by 2030. The goal of establishing 22 Pinaka regiments by 2030 underscores the system's central role in India's artillery modernization.\n\nThe Pinaka program exemplifies India's Aatmanirbhar Bharat mission, showcasing indigenous defense capabilities that match global standards. From the proven Mk-I systems currently guarding borders to the futuristic Mk-IV with its quasi-ballistic missile capabilities, Pinaka represents India's evolution from weapons importer to defense technology innovator.\n\nThis comprehensive rocket artillery family will provide the Indian Army with layered strike capabilities, combining rapid-fire saturation attacks with precision strikes deep into enemy territory -- a formidable deterrent that strengthens India's defensive posture while demonstrating technological self-reliance.\n\n-----E.O.M\n\n(Girish Linganna is an award-winning science communicator and a Defence, Aerospace & Geopolitical Analyst.

    "content": "FOX Business reporter Jeff Flock gets an inside look at the building of the Golden Dome in Utah on 'Fox Report.'\n\nLockheed Martin is designing a space-based missile interceptor and aims to test the technology for potential integration into President Donald Trump's \"Golden Dome\" defense shield within the next three years.\n\nThe defense contractor revealed this week that it hopes to test a satellite defensive weapon capable of destroying hypersonic missiles by 2028.\n\nIf successful, this would mark the first time in history the United States has deployed interceptors in space to destroy enemy missiles before they reach the homeland. Lockheed is still weighing different technologies, ranging from lasers to kinetic satellites that could maneuver and strike high-speed targets in flight.\n\n\"We have missile warning and tracking satellites made by Lockheed Martin in orbit today that provide timely detection and warning of missile threats,\" said Amanda Pound, mission strategy and advanced capabilities director at Lockheed Martin Space, told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"We are committed to making space-based interceptors for missile defense a reality, leveraging our decades of experience, investments, and industry partnerships, to be ready for on orbit testing in 2028.\"\n\nTRUMP UNVEILS 'GOLDEN DOME' MISSILE SHIELD, BLINDSIDES KEY SENATORS\n\nLockheed's space interceptor project directly supports Trump's \"Golden Dome for America\" initiative, first unveiled in May 2025. The ambitious missile defense concept calls for a global constellation of satellites armed with sensors and interceptors, designed to detect, track and eliminate advanced missile threats - including hypersonic and ballistic weapons - before they can strike U.S. soil.\n\nThe idea echoes President Ronald Reagan's 1983 Strategic Defense Initiative, often dubbed \"Star Wars,\" which was dismissed at the time as science fiction. But today, the technologies once seen as far-fetched are rapidly advancing, according to defense leaders.\n\nGen. Michael Guetlein, appointed by the Trump administration to head Golden Dome, emphasized that key components of the system already exist, expressing confidence in achieving a test-ready platform by 2028. Still, it's no easy feat.\n\n\"Intercepting a missile in orbit is a pretty wicked hard problem physics\u2011wise,\" said Jeff Schrader, vice president of Lockheed's space division. \"But not impossible,\" he added, noting breakthroughs in maneuverability and guidance systems.\n\nAnalysts caution that to make the Golden Dome vision a reality, the U.S. may need to launch thousands of interceptors into orbit. Some have compared it to the Cold War-era \"Brilliant Pebbles\" program, which proposed a similar space-based missile shield but was eventually shelved due to skyrocketing costs and technical hurdles.\n\nGolden Dome is currently projected to cost $175 billion, with $25 billion already approved by Congress. But long-term estimates range anywhere from $161 billion to over $830 billion over two decades - raising questions about the program's affordability and long-term sustainability.\n\nTRUMP'S 'GOLDEN DOME' WILL NEED MANHATTAN PROJECT-SCALE WHOLE-OF-GOVERNMENT EFFORT, SPACE FORCE GENERAL WARNS\n\nMeanwhile, Lockheed is bolstering ground-based missile defense systems to complement the orbital layer. In March 2025, the company's Aegis Combat System aboard the USS Pinckney successfully simulated the interception of hypersonic medium-range missiles during the FTX-40 exercise, codenamed Stellar Banshee.\n\nThe company is also advancing infrared seeker technology for interceptors, which would enhance the tracking and targeting of fast-moving missiles in their terminal phase.\n\nLockheed remains a central player in the Pentagon's broader missile defense and hypersonic weapons development effort. It is the prime contractor for the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI), which is targeting an initial operating capability by the end of fiscal year 2028.\n\nSimultaneously, the company is fulfilling Navy contracts for its Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) hypersonic weapons system. Sea-based deployment of CPS is expected to begin between 2027 and 2028.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPresident Trump has publicly stated he wants Golden Dome operational by the end of his term. But industry officials warn that supply chain limitations and the Pentagon's slow-moving procurement system make full deployment by 2029 unlikely.",

    "title": "Croatia deploys first German-made Leopard 2A4HRV as interim force before retiring Soviet-era M-84 tanks",
    "content": "The Leopard 2A4HRV is a Croatian variant of the German Leopard 2A4 tank equipped with SEM 80/90 radios, serving as a transitional platform for training and display before the arrival of the Leopard 2A8 fleet. (Picture source: X/Ronkainen)\n\nThe Leopard 2A4HRV is based on the standard Leopard 2A4 tank produced by Germany between 1985 and 1992. It retains the vertical turret structure without the angular appliqu\u00e9 armor introduced in subsequent variants such as the 2A5, 2A6, or 2A8. The vehicle is equipped with a Rheinmetall 120 mm L/44 smoothbore main gun and supports a stabilized fire control system with digital components, a laser rangefinder, and optical devices for both daytime and nighttime use. Its propulsion system is the MTU MB 873 Ka-501 liquid-cooled, V12 twin-turbo diesel engine, producing 1,500 horsepower and allowing a maximum road speed of up to 70 kilometers per hour. It has an estimated operational range of 450 to 500 kilometers and a combat weight of approximately 55 tonnes. Passive protection is provided against kinetic energy and high-explosive anti-tank projectiles, and the vehicle includes resistance to anti-tank mines and handheld anti-armor weapons. No active protection system or modular armor is installed on this version.\n\nA distinctive feature of the Leopard 2A4HRV is its use of the German SEM 80/90 VHF radio system rather than the SINCGARS RT-1702E system used in Croatia's M-84A tanks. The SEM 80/90 system, introduced in the early 1980s and still manufactured by Thales as of 2021, operates in the VHF band between 30.0 and 79.975 MHz using 25 kHz channel spacing. It is available in low-power (~0.4 W and 4 W) and high-power (~4 W and 40 W) configurations, depending on the SEM 80 or SEM 90 variant. When mounted with a vehicle antenna (FA-80), it can reach up to 17 kilometers; with a stationary antenna (STA-80), range can extend up to 30 kilometers. In contrast, SINCGARS covers 30.000 to 87.975 MHz with the same channel spacing but supports frequency hopping and integrated encryption. It provides single-channel and frequency-hopping operation, is compatible across NATO platforms, and achieves operational ranges up to 35 to 40 kilometers with amplification. The Leopard 2A4HRV's use of SEM 80/90 reflects its limited operational scope and non-interoperability with current NATO digital systems.\n\nThe two Leopard 2A4HRV units were delivered by Germany as part of a broader military agreement. On October 28, 2024, Croatian Defense Minister Ivan Anu\u0161i\u0107 and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius signed a letter of intent in which Croatia committed to transferring 30 M-84 main battle tanks and 30 M-80 infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine. In return, Germany agreed to supply Croatia with up to 50 Leopard 2A8 tanks beginning in 2027. This agreement allowed Croatia to modernize its armored forces while contributing to Ukraine's defense. The two Leopard 2A4HRV tanks were delivered between the signing of the agreement and their public presentation during the 2025 military parade. They serve exclusively as non-combat assets for training and display purposes. Croatia currently fields no other Leopard variants and maintains only these two 2A4HRV units as placeholders until the 2A8 fleet enters service.\n\nPrior to this agreement, Croatia had attempted to acquire Leopard 2 tanks on several occasions. In 2014 and 2015, discussions with Germany focused on the possible procurement of Leopard 2A5 tanks, intended to complement the acquisition of PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzers. Due to financial constraints, Croatia was unable to proceed with the tank purchase. In the years that followed, the Croatian Army continued to operate M-84A4 \"Sniper\" tanks, a Yugoslav-era modification of the Soviet T-72 featuring improved fire control and communications systems. These upgrades did not include enhancements to passive or modular armor, and the vehicles retained protection levels similar to early-generation T-72 models. The decision to transfer M-84A4 tanks and M-80 IFVs to Ukraine in exchange for Leopard 2A8s was announced in 2023 and became part of Croatia's broader strategy to modernize its ground forces using Western platforms.\n\nThe Leopard 2A8 tanks expected to replace Croatia's M-84A4 fleet are based on the Leopard 2A7HU standard and include significant upgrades. These tanks will feature advanced armor protection, integration of the Israeli Trophy active protection system, and improved situational awareness through enhanced sensor fusion. Delivery is planned from 2027 onward and is expected to be completed by 2030. The total value of the Leopard 2A8 procurement is estimated at \u20ac1 billion. Croatia's \u20ac144 million aid package to Ukraine, which includes the transferred tanks and IFVs, is subtracted from the total cost. The acquisition also includes spare parts, additional engines, tank transporters, and engineering vehicles. The 2A8 tanks will replace all remaining M-84A4s in Croatian service and bring the country's armored forces closer to full NATO interoperability in terms of firepower, survivability, and communications infrastructure.\n\nThe Leopard 2A4HRV is not configured for combat use and lacks modern survivability enhancements, but it plays a functional role in Croatia's transition toward the Leopard 2A8 standard. These two tanks serve as instructional platforms, allowing Croatian personnel to train on the Leopard chassis and familiarize themselves with basic maintenance and operational procedures. They represent the first instance of Leopard 2 systems being fielded by Croatia, a country that, until 2025, had relied exclusively on M-84-based armored vehicles. Their deployment during the 2025 parade served both symbolic and preparatory purposes. Until the Leopard 2A8 begins arriving from Germany in 2027, the Leopard 2A4HRV will continue to serve a limited but relevant role in national defense planning, training infrastructure, and public military visibility.",

These delays temporarily slowed the production line but did not compromise the contract overall, which may still be expanded, as the Philippine side has expressed interest in acquiring a total of 114 vehicles in various configurations.\n\nThe Guarani 6x6, officially designated VBTP-MR, is a multi-role armored vehicle jointly developed by the Brazilian Army and the defense division of Iveco. Designed for operations in diverse environments, including urban areas, rural terrain, and forests, the Guarani combines tactical mobility, ballistic protection, and onboard firepower. In service in Brazil since 2013, it was previously exported to Lebanon, which received 16 units in 2015 for use by internal security forces under the Ministry of Interior. The vehicle is also being offered to other international customers.\n\nIn the Philippine context, the Guarani is part of the Wheeled APC Acquisition under Horizon 2 of the Revised Armed Forces of the Philippines Modernization Program (RAFPMP). Procurement has been facilitated through the Israeli company Elbit Systems, which is also integrating several subsystems: remotely operated RCWS armed with 12.7mm machine guns, a battlefield management system, and tactical communication equipment.\n\nSome sources also point to a possible enhanced configuration for the Philippine batch, including a remote-controlled turret fitted with a 30mm automatic cannon. This version would increase the vehicle's engagement capabilities, suitable for both urban security tasks and operations in open terrain against a range of threats. The acquisition aligns with the Philippine strategy to develop a more mobile and better-equipped ground force capable of operating across the country and responding to various internal and external security challenges.\n\nThe overall contract, signed in 2020 and valued at an estimated $46 million, provides for a phased delivery of the 28 initial units. The upcoming shipment of nine vehicles in August marks another step in the implementation of the agreement, ahead of the final batch of 14 units. At the same time, Brazil sees this deal as an opportunity to establish a stronger position in the Asian defense market, using it as diplomatic and industrial leverage in a competitive sector where regulatory dynamics are as important as technical performance.\n\nThe imminent delivery of these nine Guarani vehicles reflects not only the ongoing cooperation between Bras\u00edlia and Manila but also the practical and procedural realities of international defense exports. Despite previous delays caused by German export controls, the program remains on track with potential for expansion. The integration of these vehicles into the Philippine Army marks a notable development in its modernization process, while contributing to Brazil's efforts to advance its defense industry on the global stage.",

For ballistic missile defense, the system must be able to detect a very small, difficult-to-detect target (-10 dBsm) at a range of 2233 km (1387 miles) and track up to 24 complex targets. For hypersonic threats, it needs to handle a similarly small target (-20 dBsm) at a 375 km range with the ability to track 10 complex targets; low-elevation acquisition is a key requirement. Similarly, for cruise missiles, the radar must track a small target (-20 dBsm) at 200 km, managing up to 24 targets at a time.\n\nThe system also must maintain track identity and discern warheads from decoys within 180 seconds.\n\nThe radar is designed to be mobile, not a static, fixed-site system, with an ambitious deployment timeline. It must be transportable and capable of being fully operational and calibrated within 48 hours of reaching a site. The system is also highly autonomous, requiring no more than two onsite personnel for maintenance, with radar operations, software updates, and continuous calibration managed remotely.\n\nIt must also interface with the existing battle management systems of the MDA and the US Army and provide in-flight guidance updates to interceptors.\n\nAccording to the RFI, the production schedule calls for the first radar unit to be completed by Dec 31, 2028, and two more units by Dec 31, 2029.

    "title": "Russia announces first delivery of Oreshnik ballistic missile to challenge US long-range dominance in Europe",
    "content": "This announcement could be interpreted as a direct signal that Russia is no longer observing any limitations previously imposed by the now-defunct INF Treaty, effectively marking a formal return to ground-based missile deployments in the 500 to 5,500 kilometer range. (Picture source: Russian MoD)\n\nThe Oreshnik missile, also designated as SS-X-34, is a solid-fueled, road-mobile, intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) believed to be derived from the RS-26 Rubezh, which was previously excluded from Russia's armament program. According to open-source data, the missile weighs approximately 40 tons, has an estimated throw-weight of at least 1,200 kg, and a range between 800 and 5,000 km. The system uses a mobile launcher based on the MZKT-79291 chassis or a modified version thereof, and was developed by the Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology with participation from several other Russian entities, including Titan-Barrikady, FCDT Soyuz, CNIIAG, OKB Proyektor, and Concern Sozvezdiye. It features a two-stage solid-fuel configuration, likely equipped with a multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) payload. Each missile is assessed to carry six individual warheads, each of which may be equipped with six submunitions or decoys. The MIRV configuration may use either a traditional post-boost vehicle (\"bus\") or a newer design featuring individual guidance and propulsion systems for each warhead.\n\nThe first operational use of the Oreshnik missile occurred on November 21, 2024, during a strike against Ukraine's Pivdenmash defense plant in Dnipro. The missile was launched from the Kapustin Yar test range and reportedly achieved a flight speed of Mach 11. The strike lasted approximately 15 minutes and occurred following a prior notification to the United States through established deconfliction channels. Ukrainian and U.S. sources reported that the missile carried inert or non-explosive warheads. Satellite imagery and local reports confirmed limited structural damage, including minor roof impacts at the industrial facility. The event followed prior warnings from U.S. intelligence to Ukraine and NATO allies about a possible significant Russian airstrike, leading to temporary closures of Western embassies in Kyiv. The missile was identified by serial numbers linking it to legacy Bulava missile components, and fragments of a post-boost propulsion system were recovered at the site. President Putin stated that the launch was in response to Western authorization for Ukraine to use long-range missiles like ATACMS and Storm Shadow against Russian territory.\n\nFollowing the strike, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the attack as a significant escalation and a violation of the UN Charter. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz characterized it as a severe provocation and stated that Germany would not deliver Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine to avoid further escalation. NATO's Ukraine Council labeled the strike an attempt to intimidate civilians and Western supporters of Ukraine. Several international organizations and media outlets, including The Economist and the Institute for the Study of War, assessed the strike as part of a broader Russian campaign of psychological pressure, intended to increase the cost of Western support to Ukraine. Analysts from CSIS and other institutions noted that the use of MIRVs in conventional payloads remains uncommon due to accuracy limitations and high operational costs. They also observed that the missile's flight profile, trajectory, and terminal phase would be difficult to intercept with Ukraine's existing missile defense capabilities.\n\nMilitary experts, including Maksim Starchak and Jeffrey Lewis, assessed that the Oreshnik system does not incorporate new or advanced technology beyond legacy Soviet and Russian missile developments. According to Lewis, the system consists of well-established components repurposed into a new configuration, and he estimated that no more than 10 percent of the design was new. Analysts highlighted that the use of kinetic-energy-only warheads traveling at hypersonic speed can result in localized damage, though the system's military utility with non-nuclear payloads remains limited. According to Western analysts, the use of such a costly system for a limited physical effect likely reflects a political or strategic messaging function. This interpretation was reinforced by statements from CSIS and Chatham House experts, who emphasized the system's symbolic value rather than battlefield effectiveness. Observers also noted the risk of strategic misinterpretation, as adversaries may respond to Oreshnik launches as if they were nuclear, given the missile's configuration and range.\n\nReports in early August 2025 from Russian and international sources indicated that Russia is considering overseas deployment of the Oreshnik system. Military expert Alexander Stepanov suggested that locations such as Venezuela and Cuba could serve as forward basing options. He argued that such deployments would reinforce Russia's military presence and provide extended strike coverage of the southern United States and Caribbean region. Stepanov also noted that serial production capabilities could allow for the delivery of dozens of units annually, covering multiple strategic sectors and possibly opening avenues for technology transfer to partners such as Iran, North Korea, and China. Although these countries maintain their own missile development programs, none are currently believed to possess a missile equivalent to Oreshnik. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin is producing up to 60 HIMARS systems annually, with plans to increase output to 92, while the U.S. Department of Defense has placed orders for 32 Tomahawk missiles and Typhon launchers for NATO deployments.\n\nThe deployment of the Oreshnik system to Belarus fits into a broader Russian strategic framework that includes revisions to its nuclear doctrine and a series of agreements with Minsk. In late 2024, Putin and Lukashenko signed a treaty granting Belarus Russian security guarantees, including the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons. According to Belarusian statements, several dozen such weapons have already been deployed. The new Russian doctrine also allows the use of nuclear weapons in the event of an attack on Belarus with conventional means threatening its sovereignty. Russia's exit from INF Treaty constraints has been formalized, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defense both confirming that INF-related self-limitations no longer apply. Analyst Vasily Kashin stated that future deployment sites for systems such as Oreshnik would be selected based on specific operational characteristics, with northern and southwestern regions of Russia, including areas near NATO borders, as likely candidates. He also noted the historical precedent of deploying Pioneer IRBMs to Chukotka during the Cold War, capable of reaching parts of the continental United States.",

    "title": "U.S. Dark Eagle Hypersonic Weapon in Australia to counter Chinese Threat in Indo-Pacific",
    "content": "The Dark Eagle strikes over 2,775 km at Mach 5+ with a maneuverable glide body, evading defenses (Picture source: U.S. Army)\n\nThe Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon, also referred to as the Dark Eagle system, is among the most advanced elements of the U.S. Army's long-range precision fires portfolio. The system is built around the Common Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB), developed in partnership with the U.S. Navy, and a two-stage solid rocket booster. Once launched, the C-HGB separates and glides through the atmosphere at speeds exceeding Mach 5, with the ability to maneuver laterally and vertically, making it highly unpredictable and extremely difficult for conventional missile defense systems to intercept. The range of the system is officially classified, but it is estimated to exceed 2,775 kilometers, enabling it to strike deeply into denied environments. The complete LRHW battery includes mobile launchers mounted on M870A4 trailers, a Battery Operations Center for fire mission planning, and support vehicles designed for rapid deployment and setup.\n\nThis deployment to Australia is not only a demonstration of technological maturity but also a carefully calibrated geopolitical signal. Amid intensifying strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific, the positioning of hypersonic assets in Australia sends a clear message regarding U.S. intent and capability. The People's Republic of China has significantly expanded its anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) umbrella, with a growing arsenal of long-range missiles, air defense systems, and anti-ship capabilities aimed at deterring U.S. military presence in the Western Pacific. By placing the LRHW within range of potential regional flashpoints such as the Taiwan Strait, the South China Sea, and the First Island Chain, the U.S. and its allies are enhancing their ability to conduct deterrence by denial. Australia's strategic location provides a secure, sovereign platform for operations beyond the reach of most adversary strike systems, while its close political and military alignment with Washington under the AUKUS and Quad frameworks makes it a natural partner for such a capability.\n\nFrom a tactical and operational standpoint, the deployment serves as a validation of the U.S. Army's evolving doctrine of Multi-Domain Operations (MDO). The 3rd Multi-Domain Task Force was specifically designed to integrate long-range fires, cyber-electromagnetic activities, space operations, and intelligence in order to support joint forces in contested environments. The LRHW serves as a central component of this concept, enabling long-range precision strikes against time-critical and high-value targets in support of air and maritime campaigns. During Talisman Sabre, the system was fully integrated into joint command-and-control architecture, enabling real-time sensor-to-shooter engagements, simulated strategic targeting, and mission rehearsals under coalition command structures. The exercise also tested logistical movement, deployment timelines, launcher setup in austere environments, and sustainment of advanced munitions in theater, all critical components of operational readiness.\n\nThe presence of the Dark Eagle in Australia also marks a turning point in the U.S. Army's return to theater-level strike capabilities. For decades, long-range conventional strike has been largely the domain of the U.S. Air Force and Navy. With the reemergence of peer adversaries, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, the Army is now reasserting its relevance in strategic deterrence through land-based hypersonic and mid-range systems. The LRHW's capability to deliver immediate and precise effects across the depth of an adversary's battlespace gives joint force commanders a powerful new option to shape the battlefield and suppress enemy capabilities before they can be employed. This is particularly relevant in scenarios where access to air or maritime platforms may be contested or delayed.\n\nThis historic fielding of the LRHW in Australia represents more than just the arrival of a new weapon system, it signals a transformative shift in U.S. Army force posture, deterrence strategy, and allied integration in the Indo-Pacific. As the race for hypersonic supremacy accelerates globally, the U.S. Army has demonstrated that it not only possesses the technological edge but is also willing and able to forward-deploy it in support of allies.

    "content": "HUNTSVILLE, Alabama -- The U.S. Army's Space and Missile Defense Command will in the next three months release a new long-term strategy guiding its modernization, focused on key lessons from recent engagements in the Middle East and long-term learning from Ukraine.\n\nLt. Gen. Sean Gainey, commander of SMDC, tells reporters this includes a push for missile defeat -- a recognition that it is no longer possible to think of a one-for-one missile to interceptor ratio. Recent incidents, such as Iran's large-scale attacks on Israel within the past two years, have shown that the complexity will increase.\n\n\"We have to find a way to attrit the missiles or whatever's being fired at us prior to them actually launching it, because if you don't attack their inventory, it's very difficult to have a sustained magazine depth until some of the directed-energy, high-powered microwave technologies are brought on board,\" Gainey says. \"So you have to do missile defeat from the holistic perspective.\"\n\nFor example, the U.S. military conducted its largest-ever Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system intercept in June downing incoming Iranian missiles. Patriot interceptors, particularly the high-end PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhanced, have been in high use countering Iranian attacks while also being deployed to Ukraine.\n\nThis numbers game is not in the U.S.'s favor when compared to the cost of some of the incoming missiles and drones.\n\nGainey says the upcoming strategy reflects lessons that upcoming attacks will be complex, with missiles, drones and ballistic missiles fired simultaneously with the goal of overwhelming defense operators. Systems like the Army's Integrated Battle Command System seek to alleviate some of that, and officials are pressing for increased artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomy to help reduce the workload.\n\nThe attacks have shown that an enemy will specifically target air and missile defense systems, and officials at the Space and Missile Defense Symposium here are pressing industry to help develop defensive systems that can be operated remotely.\n\n\"The main thing from a lesson learned perspective is complexity, mass and an attempt to seek and hunt air and missile defense assets on the battlefield, and so all of those lessons learned are all factored into how we're moving forward,\" Gainey says.\n\nIn the near term, the Army plans to increase its air and missile defense force structure by 30% over the next eight years.

    "title": "$225M acquisition of Daedalean marks one of the largest deals in sutonomous flight and aviation AI  --  TFN",
    "content": "To reshape the future of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), Destinus Group BV has signed a binding agreement to acquire Zurich-based Daedalean AG for $225 million. The transaction, comprising both cash and stock, is expected to close by the end of 2025 and will merge two of Europe's most innovative aerospace players.\n\nThe acquisition underscores Destinus' ambition to strengthen its position in both the defence and civil drone markets at a time when demand for autonomous capabilities is accelerating. Global defence budgets, evolving aviation regulations, and the push for resilient air systems are fueling a wave of consolidation across the drone industry. The Destinus-Daedalean deal is one of the most notable examples of this strategic realignment.\n\nFounded in 2021 by Mikhail Kokorich, Destinus has become one of Europe's largest UAV manufacturers, with a workforce of over 500 and operations spanning Germany, Switzerland, France, the UK, Spain, and Ukraine. While the company is best known for its flight systems expertise and manufacturing scale, it is now deepening its focus on intelligent autonomy, an area where Daedalean's capabilities are unmatched.\n\nDaedalean, established in 2016 by a former engineer from Google and SpaceX Luuk van Dijk, is known for developing safety-critical avionics software. Its systems are designed to assist in piloting, provide environmental awareness, and ensure navigation even in GPS-denied environments, an increasingly vital requirement in contested or remote airspaces. The company employs over 150 specialists, including 13 PhDs with expertise spanning avionics, navigation, and advanced computational methods.\n\nBy bringing Daedalean into its fold, Destinus gains access to a highly skilled team and a portfolio of certified technologies that can be immediately integrated into future UAV designs. These tools are expected to enhance decision-making for operators, improve swarm coordination, and increase resilience in complex mission scenarios.\n\nWhile Daedalean has traditionally served the broader aviation market, recent months have seen it place greater emphasis on defence-related applications. The company has signalled a pivot toward developing systems capable of operating independently in dynamic and high-risk environments, reducing the need for constant human control.\n\nThis shift mirrors broader defence trends in 2025, where investment is increasingly directed toward autonomous solutions that can adapt in real time to evolving conditions. The combination of Destinus' manufacturing infrastructure and Daedalean's software innovation aims to meet this demand head-on, positioning the merged entity as a leading provider of advanced UAV systems for both military and civilian use.\n\nThe integration is expected to deliver faster product development cycles. Destinus' aerospace engineering and manufacturing strengths, coupled with Daedalean's software proficiency, create a vertically integrated platform capable of bringing new UAV concepts from design to deployment more efficiently.\n\nBoth companies have collaborated in the past, laying a foundation of mutual trust and technical compatibility. This shared history will likely ease the integration process and enable early delivery of joint innovations.\n\nFor defence applications, the focus will be on systems that can operate in contested environments with minimal operator oversight. In the civilian sector, the combined expertise could enable safer cargo drones, enhanced air taxis, and more effective environmental monitoring platforms.\n\nAutonomous flight technology, once viewed as a futuristic concept, is now central to both military planning and commercial strategy. Countries are investing in systems that can conduct surveillance, deliver supplies, and perform reconnaissance without endangering human crews. In parallel, civilian markets are seeking solutions for logistics, agriculture, and disaster response that are both cost-effective and adaptable.\n\nBy combining their strengths, Destinus and Daedalean are positioning themselves to lead in both arenas, offering products that can operate across a spectrum of conditions and requirements.\n\nOnce the deal closes, integration efforts will focus on aligning product development roadmaps, consolidating research programs, and leveraging combined resources to accelerate market entry for new UAV models.\n\nThe acquisition not only expands Destinus' technological capabilities but also solidifies its role as a key player in Europe's fast-growing autonomous aviation sector. For Daedalean, joining Destinus offers a pathway to scale its innovations more rapidly and deploy them in a wider range of applications.\n\nAs global interest in unmanned systems continues to climb, this deal could prove pivotal in shaping the next generation of aerial technologies, ones that operate with greater independence, reliability, and adaptability than ever before.\n\nTim Moser, Co-founder and CTO of Destinus, commented: \"This acquisition strengthens our technological position by adding world-class AI expertise and deep-learning specialists. Integrating Daedalean's innovative solutions and exceptional team will accelerate our strategy to develop, certify, and launch intelligent UAV systems for defence and civil markets.\"\n\n\"Joining Destinus is a logical next step after our successful collaboration,\" added Bas Gouverneur, CEO of Daedalean. \"Together, we'll deliver innovative AI-driven autonomy, swarm intelligence, and sophisticated decision-making tools to market faster, making flight safer, more resilient, and operationally flexible.\"",

The weapons cleared under the 'acceptance of necessity' (AoN) by the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, are aimed at strengthening strike and surveillance capabilities across all three armed forces.\n\nThe Indian Air Force had used BrahMos missiles and Israeli-origin kamikaze drones during recent hostilities with Pakistan in May under Operation Sindoor. The 87 new drones, capable of returning to base after strike missions, are intended to speed up induction compared to the 31 MQ-9B Predator drones from the US, which will only be delivered in 2029-30.\n\nAccording to defence ministry officials and reports from the Times of India:\n\nThe MALE drones, which come with intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and strike capabilities, are expected to be inducted faster than the MQ-9B Predator HALE (high-altitude, long-endurance) drones ordered from the US for \u20b932,350 crore in October last year, which will be delivered only in the 2029-30 timeframe. Officials said the need for such systems was evident during Operation Sindoor.\n\nWhile India had previously used Israeli-origin Harop and Harpy drones as kamikaze systems during cross-border operations, the new drones will offer reusable strike capability and long-range endurance.\n\nThe BrahMos missile, jointly developed by India and Russia, has become the primary conventional precision-strike weapon for the armed forces. The missile has been deployed on warships, aircraft and mobile launchers, with cumulative contracts exceeding \u20b958,000 crore to date.\n\nIn March 2023, the ministry signed a \u20b919,519 crore deal for over 220 BrahMos missiles for frontline warships.

This transatlantic cooperation reflects the strategic importance of the ACV program, which is intended not only to replace the aging fleet of Amphibious Assault Vehicles (AAVs) but also to serve as a modular, scalable platform capable of addressing current and future threats.\n\nThe contract covers the production of MCT-30 turrets, stabilized and remotely operated systems capable of integrating the XM813 30 mm chain gun, various armor configurations, and anti-tank guided missiles. The ACV-30, one of four variants in the ACV family, addresses a longstanding capability gap by providing Marine infantry units with mobile, organic, and accurate fire support during both amphibious assaults and ground operations.\n\nUnlike the ACV-P troop transport variant, the ACV-30 is equipped with a direct fire system enabling stabilized engagements on the move, day or night, including with programmable airburst munitions effective against drones, light armored vehicles, or fortified positions in both open and urban terrain.\n\nThe vehicle is based on a proven 8x8 wheeled chassis, weighs over 35 tons, and is powered by a 700-horsepower engine, allowing speeds over 65 mph (105 km/h) on land and up to 6 knots at sea. It features an open electronic architecture and modular armor, enabling future upgrades such as active protection systems or electronic warfare capabilities.\n\nThe contract follows an earlier milestone in November 2024, when the Marine Corps committed USD 51 million to acquire long-lead items required to launch the program. This new order is the first full-rate production contract issued by the Program Executive Office Land Systems under the Program Manager Advanced Amphibious Assault (PM AAA). It includes an initial order for around one hundred turrets to be manufactured in the United States at Kongsberg's facility in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, which has been expanded to accommodate a dedicated medium-caliber turret production line.\n\nSince 2008, more than 20,000 remotely operated weapon systems have been produced at this facility for U.S. military programs such as MADIS and CROWS. In parallel, BAE Systems has received a contract modification worth USD 181.1 million to produce 31 ACV-30 vehicles, along with deployment and logistical support. Production will be distributed across five U.S. sites, including York, Aiken, San Jose, Sterling Heights, and Stafford, while hulls will be provided by Iveco in Italy. Final delivery is expected by September 2027.\n\nBoth contracts are funded through fiscal year 2025 procurement accounts and are managed by Marine Corps Systems Command in Quantico, Virginia. Additional options could raise the total value of the ACV contract to USD 3.85 billion and that of the turrets to USD 271.4 million.\n\nA portion of the turret manufacturing will also be carried out in Norway, with 38 percent of the industrial workload. With this new step, the Marine Corps is advancing its amphibious warfare capabilities through a system designed to be modular, interoperable, and adaptable. The ACV-30 fits directly into the Force Design 2030 initiative, which aims to reconfigure the Marine Corps for distributed operations and high-intensity conflict.\n\nDesigned to meet the requirements of future expeditionary operations, the ACV-30 provides front-line, embedded direct fire support. It is intended to accompany dismounted units during complex littoral assaults and extended ground engagements, including in contested environments where mobility and firepower offer a tactical advantage.\n\nWith its amphibious mobility, high protection levels, and advanced weapon system, the vehicle integrates into the U.S. Marine Corps' concept of Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO), supporting dispersed force deployment and precision strikes against threats located in anti-access environments. The ACV-30 is thus a key component in maintaining operational freedom for U.S. forces against technologically capable adversaries.",

The BrahMos missiles, previously used against Pakistani targets, will enhance the Air Force's strike capabilities. The 87 drones, with ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) and weapon-carrying capability, will cost around \u20b920,000 crore. Another \u20b911,000 crore will be for logistical and other support by the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) for 10 years,\" the senior official added.\n\nIndia, of course, had used Israeli-origin Harop and Harpy kamikaze drones, which act as cruise missiles by exploding into enemy assets and radars, to hit targets deep inside Pakistan during the May 7-10 hostilities.\n\nThe armed forces hope to induct the 87 new MALE drones, which return to their bases after strike missions, faster than the 31-armed MQ-9B 'Predator' HALE (high-altitude, long endurance) drones ordered from the US for \u20b932,350 crore in Oct last year, which will be delivered only in the 2029-30 timeframe.\n\nThe over 110 air-launched BrahMos missiles, which are jointly manufactured by India and Russia, in turn, will cost around \u20b910,800 crore.\n\nThese 450-km range missiles, which fly almost three times the speed of sound at Mach 2.8, combined with Sukhoi-30MKI fighters, with a combat radius of about 1,500-km, constitute a deadly weapons package, as was witnessed during Operation Sindoor.\n\nThe DAC also accorded AoN for eight BrahMos fire control systems and vertical launchers for older Indian warships for \u20b9650 crore.\n\nAround 20 frontline warships, including the latest destroyers and frigates, are already armed with the BrahMos missiles. In March last year, the defence ministry had inked a \u20b919,519 crore deal for procurement of over 220 BrahMos missiles for frontline warships with the Indo-Russian joint venture BrahMos Aerospace. The total value of deals inked for BrahMos has crossed \u20b958,000 crore over the years, with the missiles becoming the \"prime conventional (non-nuclear) precision strike weapons\" for the armed forces.\n\nFor the Army, the DAC gave the nod for new thermal imager-based driver night-sights for infantry combat vehicles (BMPs). \"This would provide higher mobility and operational advantage,\" another official said.\n\nThe defence ministry on Tuesday gave the initial nod for the procurement of 87 new heavy-duty armed drones and over 110 more air-launched BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, which IAF used as the primary weapon to strike Pakistani airbases and radar sites in May, among several modernisation proposals collectively worth \u20b967,000 crore, reports Rajat Pandit.\n\nThe acceptance of necessity granted by the Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisition Council for the 87 armed medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) remotely-piloted aircraft will see an Indian company tying up with a foreign one to produce the drones with \"an indigenous content of 60 per cent\". \"The need for such MALE drones, armed with air-to-ground missiles and laser-guided bombs as well as capable of operating at long ranges, was acutely felt for the three services during Operation Sindoor,\" a senior official told TOI.",
    "description": "The drones, crucial for long-range operations, will be produced in India with 60 per cent indigenous content. The BrahMos missiles, previously used against Pakistani targets, will enhance the Air Force's strike capabilities. The 87 drones, with ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) and weapon-carrying capability, will cost around \u20b920,000 crore. Another \u20b911,000 crore will be for logistical and other support by the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) for 10 years,\" the senior offic",

    "content": "India has approved a major defence deal that will boost the country's military power. On Tuesday, the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), led by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, cleared military projects worth around Rs. 67,000 crore. This includes advanced weapons like missile systems, air defence networks, long-range drones, and radar systems -- all of which will strengthen the Army, Air Force, and Navy.\n\nAs part of this plan, the Indian Navy will get upgrades for the BrahMos fire control system, BrahMos missile launchers, and the Barak-1 point defence missile system. The Navy will also buy new Compact Autonomous Surface Craft (CASC) robotic boats that can track and neutralize enemy submarines. These boats will help in undersea warfare by spotting and stopping threats from enemy submarines.\n\nThe Indian Air Force will soon get special mountain radars that can keep a close watch on enemy movements in difficult and high-altitude areas. Along with this, the SPYDER air defence system will also be upgraded so it can be connected to the Integrated Air Command system which will improve its coordination and response.\n\nThe government has also approved the purchase of Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) drones for all three armed forces. These drones will be equipped with heavy weapons and advanced sensors. They can stay in the air 24/7, monitor enemy activity, locate targets, and carry out precise attacks. These drones will greatly improve surveillance and strike capabilities, especially along India's borders and during missions like surgical strikes.\n\nThe Defence Ministry has also cleared a major yearly maintenance contract for the powerful S-400 air defence system. In addition, initial approval has been given for the maintenance of the Indian Air Force's heavy transport aircraft i.e. the C-17 Globemaster and the C-130J Super Hercules.\n\nThis defence deal is especially important right now, as India faces security challenges from both China and Pakistan. With rising tensions along the LAC (with China) and the LoC (with Pakistan), India is now strengthening its defence with high-tech equipment. These upgrades will help not just in monitoring the borders but also in giving a strong response when needed.",

    "content": "TAIPEI (Taiwan News) -- Defense Minister Wellington Koo (\u9867\u7acb\u96c4) confirmed Tuesday that Taiwan has received the first batch of Altius-600M attack drones from US defense firm Anduril Industries, with delivery to the Army completed the same day, per CNA.\n\nThe Altius-600M is a versatile loitering munition capable of launching from land, sea, or air platforms. It has a range of 440 kilometers and can remain airborne for up to four hours. The drone supports a range of missions, including surveillance, reconnaissance, communications relay, and signal jamming.\n\nIt can also be equipped with a warhead to strike armored vehicles. Its recoverable, reusable design adds further operational flexibility.\n\nKoo met with Anduril Founder Palmer Luckey on Tuesday and said the procurement project began last year. He thanked the company for the on-time delivery and said the drones are expected to significantly enhance Taiwan's ground defense and precision strike capabilities.\n\nDrones have become a critical component of modern warfare, particularly in asymmetric conflict, Koo said. This type of warfare allows a weaker force to exploit the vulnerabilities of a stronger adversary through unconventional tactics.\n\nHe also noted that many startups are using rapid development and AI integration to build advanced weapons systems. Koo said the ministry is committed to modernizing the military and will continue expanding drone procurement.\n\nThe collaboration with Anduril marks a key step in strengthening Taiwan's defense posture and contributes to maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, he added.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Luckey delivered a speech at the ministry's lecture hall on military technological innovation in Taiwan. He stressed the importance of leveraging cutting-edge technology to bolster national security -- a message that aligns with the ministry's push for defense innovation.\n\nIn February 2024, the ministry launched a dedicated unit to collaborate with the private sector on next-generation systems, including drones, counter-drone technologies, and unmanned underwater vehicles -- key components in building a credible deterrence.\n\nOn Monday, Luckey also spoke at National Taiwan University, where he highlighted Taiwan's strengths in semiconductors, electronics, and advanced manufacturing as a foundation for a tech-driven defense industry.\n\nHe emphasized Taiwan's vital role in global democratic defense and said the country has the talent, capital, and government backing needed to develop an autonomous and resilient defense ecosystem.",

    "content": "With the US deploying intermediate-range systems in Europe and Asia, Russia says its done waiting and begins reshaping its own arsenal\n\nOn August 4, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced that Moscow is abandoning its unilateral moratorium on the deployment of ground-based intermediate- and shorter-range missiles (INF-class). The decision comes amid what Russian officials describe as an ongoing expansion of US missile systems in Europe and the Indo-Pacific, including weapons once banned under the now-defunct INF Treaty.\n\nThe US has begun placing such systems in key regions on a potentially permanent basis, undermining strategic stability and creating a direct threat to Russia's national security. Moscow is preparing military-technical countermeasures in response - and is now lifting all political constraints on the development and deployment of such systems.\n\nRT examines the situation through the lens of leading Russian military experts, who describe the move as long-anticipated, technically overdue, and strategically inevitable. Their assessments shed light on Moscow's doctrinal shift, future deployment options, and the broader geopolitical implications for Europe and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\n\nMoscow had shown restraint for several years after the US withdrew from the INF Treaty in 2019. Although legally freed from its obligations under the accord, Russia opted for a self-imposed moratorium, vowing not to deploy ground-based intermediate-range missiles unless similar US systems appeared near its borders.\n\nThat condition, the Ministry statement asserts, no longer applies.\n\nIt also pointed to broader US and allied efforts to institutionalize deployments of such missile systems across multiple theaters. Specific examples included:\n\nRussia views these developments as \"destabilizing missile buildups\" that threaten its national security \"at the strategic level.\" The Foreign Ministry stated that Moscow will now undertake \"military-technical response measures\", with the precise configuration to be determined by the Russian leadership based on inter-agency analysis and the evolving strategic environment.\n\nOfficials also referenced an earlier warning issued in June 2025, when Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said that Russia's moratorium was approaching its \"logical conclusion\" in light of \"sensitive missile threats\" being fielded by the West.\n\nWhile Russia's announcement marks a formal policy shift, experts argue that the conditions for abandoning the moratorium have been building for years - largely due to developments on the US side.\n\nAccording to military analyst Ilya Kramnik, a research fellow at the Center for Strategic Planning Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences, the deployment of INF-class systems by the United States and its allies has made Russia's restraint functionally obsolete.\n\n\"In principle, Russia has long had reason to consider itself free from any INF-related constraints,\" he notes. \"But this week's statement appears to be synchronized with the start of deliveries of the Oreshnik missile system to the armed forces.\"\n\nThe US began laying the groundwork for forward deployment of ground-based missiles as early as 2021, when it launched the formation of Multi-Domain Task Forces (MDTFs) - mobile army units designed to integrate long-range fires, precision strike, and battlefield networking. These units were to be equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles using the Typhon launcher, a land-based containerized system derived from the naval Mk.41 vertical launch platform.\n\n\"The second such group, the 2nd MDTF, was formed in Germany,\" Kramnik explains, \"with a clear orientation toward the European theater.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Typhon has been actively deployed in the Indo-Pacific, most notably to the Philippines, where it arrived during bilateral exercises but was not withdrawn. The US has also resumed tests of the PrSM missile in Australia - a platform that, in its future iterations, is expected to exceed a 1,000-km range, placing it well within INF classification.\n\nPlans for SM-6 missile deployment in Germany by 2026 - also via the Typhon system - further contributed to Russian concerns. Although originally designed as a naval interceptor, the SM-6 has evolved into a multi-role weapon with conventional strike capability.\n\nTaken together, these moves have prompted Russian officials to conclude that the United States is pursuing a strategy of \"sustained forward missile presence\" across both Europe and Asia - effectively restoring the kind of reach that the INF Treaty once prohibited.\n\n\"The military-technical reality has changed,\" says Kramnik. \"The political gesture now simply reflects that shift.\"\n\nWith the self-imposed moratorium now lifted, Russia is expected to move rapidly toward expanding its inventory of ground-based intermediate- and shorter-range missile systems. The focus, according to Russian defense experts, will be not only on production but on doctrinal adaptation and forward deployment.\n\nOne of the central components of Russia's future arsenal is the Oreshnik system - a mobile platform widely viewed as the spiritual successor to the Soviet-era Pioneer (SS-20). The weapon was first publicly hinted at in 2023, and serial deliveries to Russian troops were reported to have begun in mid-2025.\n\n\"The moratorium's expiration was long overdue,\" says Vasily Kashin, Director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at HSE University.\n\nKashin notes that Soviet missile forces had previously considered positioning Pioneer-class systems in the northeast of the country, including near Anadyr in Chukotka - from where missiles could potentially reach deep into the US mainland, including San Francisco. Modern deployment patterns, however, are likely to prioritize northwestern and southern Russia, given their proximity to NATO territory.\n\nIn addition to Oreshnik, experts expect land-based variants of the Kalibr and Tsirkon missile families to be introduced, along with new ballistic versions of the Iskander system.\n\n\"We will likely see a full spectrum of platforms: cruise, ballistic, and hypersonic,\" says Dmitry Stefanovich, co-founder of the Watfor think tank.\n\n\"These systems are already being incorporated into various service branches - not just the Strategic Missile Forces, but also the Ground Forces and the Navy's coastal units.\"\n\nStefanovich adds that Belarus is a likely site for early deployments - and that newly formed missile brigades may emerge across all Russian military districts by the end of 2025.\n\nThe lifting of Russia's moratorium revives a security dilemma once thought relegated to Cold War history - the deployment of nuclear-capable intermediate-range missiles on the European continent.\n\n\"The current trajectory evokes the Euro-missile crisis of the Cold War,\" says Sergey Oznobishchev, Director of the Institute for Strategic Assessments.\n\nUS allies are not merely accepting new deployments - some are actively seeking them. Alongside US systems, European initiatives such as the ELSA program and missile developments in South Korea and Japan are reshaping regional balances.\n\n\"This is no longer just a bilateral arms race,\" Stefanovich notes.\n\nWhile primarily strategic in nature, intermediate-range missiles may also play a role on the battlefield - particularly in Ukraine, experts suggest.\n\n\"We are likely to see more 'combat testing' of such missile systems as part of the special military operation,\" Stefanovich says. \"Their ability to strike deep, fast, and precisely makes them valuable against air defenses and critical infrastructure.\"\n\nHe predicts that Russia will form new multi-role missile formations, including equivalents of the American MDTF, capable of integrating strike systems, air defense, and electronic warfare across all branches - including VDV and Aerospace Forces.\n\n\"We are at the beginning of a multi-directional arms race,\" says Stefanovich.\n\nAlthough some experts - including Oznobishchev - suggest that a new arms control regime may eventually emerge, the current consensus is clear: restraint has ended, and military-technical competition is accelerating.\n\n\"The global trajectory is clear,\" Stefanovich concludes. \"Deterrence is back - and it's being redefined.\"",

    "title": "Russia is bringing missiles back. And this time, it's personal.  --  RT Russia & Former Soviet Union",
    "content": "With the US deploying intermediate-range systems in Europe and Asia, Russia says it's done waiting - and begins reshaping its own arsenal\n\nOn August 4, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced that Moscow is abandoning its unilateral moratorium on the deployment of ground-based intermediate- and shorter-range missiles (INF-class). The decision comes amid what Russian officials describe as an ongoing expansion of US missile systems in Europe and the Indo-Pacific, including weapons once banned under the now-defunct INF Treaty.\n\nThe US has begun placing such systems in key regions on a potentially permanent basis, undermining strategic stability and creating a direct threat to Russia's national security. Moscow is preparing military-technical countermeasures in response - and is now lifting all political constraints on the development and deployment of such systems.\n\nRT examines the situation through the lens of leading Russian military experts, who describe the move as long-anticipated, technically overdue, and strategically inevitable. Their assessments shed light on Moscow's doctrinal shift, future deployment options, and the broader geopolitical implications for Europe and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\n\nMoscow had shown restraint for several years after the US withdrew from the INF Treaty in 2019. Although legally freed from its obligations under the accord, Russia opted for a self-imposed moratorium, vowing not to deploy ground-based intermediate-range missiles unless similar US systems appeared near its borders.\n\nThat condition, the Ministry statement asserts, no longer applies.\n\n\"Since 2023, we have observed instances of US systems capable of ground-launched INF strikes being transferred to the European NATO countries for trial use during exercises that clearly have an anti-Russian slant.\"\n\nIt also pointed to broader US and allied efforts to institutionalize deployments of such missile systems across multiple theaters. Specific examples included:\n\nRussia views these developments as \"destabilizing missile buildups\" that threaten its national security \"at the strategic level.\" The Foreign Ministry stated that Moscow will now undertake \"military-technical response measures\", with the precise configuration to be determined by the Russian leadership based on inter-agency analysis and the evolving strategic environment.\n\nOfficials also referenced an earlier warning issued in June 2025, when Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said that Russia's moratorium was approaching its \"logical conclusion\" in light of \"sensitive missile threats\" being fielded by the West.\n\nWhile Russia's announcement marks a formal policy shift, experts argue that the conditions for abandoning the moratorium have been building for years - largely due to developments on the US side.\n\nAccording to military analyst Ilya Kramnik, a research fellow at the Center for Strategic Planning Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences, the deployment of INF-class systems by the United States and its allies has made Russia's restraint functionally obsolete.\n\n\"In principle, Russia has long had reason to consider itself free from any INF-related constraints,\" he notes. \"But this week's statement appears to be synchronized with the start of deliveries of the Oreshnik missile system to the armed forces.\"\n\nThe US began laying the groundwork for forward deployment of ground-based missiles as early as 2021, when it launched the formation of Multi-Domain Task Forces (MDTFs) - mobile army units designed to integrate long-range fires, precision strike, and battlefield networking. These units were to be equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles using the Typhon launcher, a land-based containerized system derived from the naval Mk.41 vertical launch platform.\n\n\"The second such group, the 2nd MDTF, was formed in Germany,\" Kramnik explains, \"with a clear orientation toward the European theater.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Typhon has been actively deployed in the Indo-Pacific, most notably to the Philippines, where it arrived during bilateral exercises but was not withdrawn. The US has also resumed tests of the PrSM missile in Australia - a platform that, in its future iterations, is expected to exceed a 1,000-km range, placing it well within INF classification.\n\nPlans for SM-6 missile deployment in Germany by 2026 - also via the Typhon system - further contributed to Russian concerns. Although originally designed as a naval interceptor, the SM-6 has evolved into a multi-role weapon with conventional strike capability.\n\nTaken together, these moves have prompted Russian officials to conclude that the United States is pursuing a strategy of \"sustained forward missile presence\" across both Europe and Asia - effectively restoring the kind of reach that the INF Treaty once prohibited.\n\n\"The military-technical reality has changed,\" says Kramnik. \"The political gesture now simply reflects that shift.\"\n\nWith the self-imposed moratorium now lifted, Russia is expected to move rapidly toward expanding its inventory of ground-based intermediate- and shorter-range missile systems. The focus, according to Russian defense experts, will be not only on production but on doctrinal adaptation and forward deployment.\n\nOne of the central components of Russia's future arsenal is the Oreshnik system - a mobile platform widely viewed as the spiritual successor to the Soviet-era Pioneer (SS-20). The weapon was first publicly hinted at in 2023, and serial deliveries to Russian troops were reported to have begun in mid-2025.\n\n\"The moratorium's expiration was long overdue,\" says Vasily Kashin, Director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at HSE University.\n\n\"The very first test of Oreshnik signaled that Russia was moving away from self-imposed limits. Now that move has been formalized - and it must be fully implemented.\"\n\nKashin notes that Soviet missile forces had previously considered positioning Pioneer-class systems in the northeast of the country, including near Anadyr in Chukotka - from where missiles could potentially reach deep into the US mainland, including San Francisco. Modern deployment patterns, however, are likely to prioritize northwestern and southern Russia, given their proximity to NATO territory.\n\nIn addition to Oreshnik, experts expect land-based variants of the Kalibr and Tsirkon missile families to be introduced, along with new ballistic versions of the Iskander system.\n\n\"We will likely see a full spectrum of platforms: cruise, ballistic, and hypersonic,\" says Dmitry Stefanovich, co-founder of the Watfor think tank.\n\n\"These systems are already being incorporated into various service branches - not just the Strategic Missile Forces, but also the Ground Forces and the Navy's coastal units.\"\n\nStefanovich adds that Belarus is a likely site for early deployments - and that newly formed missile brigades may emerge across all Russian military districts by the end of 2025.\n\nThe lifting of Russia's moratorium revives a security dilemma once thought relegated to Cold War history - the deployment of nuclear-capable intermediate-range missiles on the European continent.\n\n\"The current trajectory evokes the Euro-missile crisis of the Cold War,\" says Sergey Oznobishchev, Director of the Institute for Strategic Assessments.\n\n\"Back then, it took years of confrontation before the sides finally reached the INF Treaty. We may see a similar pattern again.\"\n\nUS allies are not merely accepting new deployments - some are actively seeking them. Alongside US systems, European initiatives such as the ELSA program and missile developments in South Korea and Japan are reshaping regional balances.\n\n\"This is no longer just a bilateral arms race,\" Stefanovich notes.\n\n\"We are witnessing a multinational acceleration - with several countries now embracing systems that were once considered too destabilizing.\"\n\nWhile primarily strategic in nature, intermediate-range missiles may also play a role on the battlefield - particularly in Ukraine, experts suggest.\n\n\"We are likely to see more 'combat testing' of such missile systems as part of the special military operation,\" Stefanovich says. \"Their ability to strike deep, fast, and precisely makes them valuable against air defenses and critical infrastructure.\"\n\nHe predicts that Russia will form new multi-role missile formations, including equivalents of the American MDTF, capable of integrating strike systems, air defense, and electronic warfare across all branches - including VDV and Aerospace Forces.\n\n\"We are at the beginning of a multi-directional arms race,\" says Stefanovich.\n\n\"This is a missile renaissance, driven not by ambition but by necessity.\"\n\nAlthough some experts - including Oznobishchev - suggest that a new arms control regime may eventually emerge, the current consensus is clear: restraint has ended, and military-technical competition is accelerating.",

    "content": "PARIS - Denmark plans to wrap up its acquisition of ground-based air defense systems by the end of the year, with a total planned investment of as much as 25 billion Danish kroner (US$3.4 billion), according to the country's Defence Ministry.\n\nFor the long-range component, Denmark expects to choose between the U.S. Patriot and the French-Italian SAMP/T system during fall 2025, the ministry told Defense News. The country intends to conclude all contracts by year-end, including a potential purchase of additional short- to medium-range systems, the MoD said.\n\nWith European policymakers observing the devastation wrought by Russian aerial attacks on Ukrainian cities, and with NATO having identified air defense as an investment priority, governments across the continent are scrambling to either bolster what they already have or put in place the means to defend their skies.\n\nDenmark in the past two months secured air defense systems from three different producers in order to build an initial capability as soon as possible, 20 years after decommissioning its air defense units operating Hawk missile systems.\n\nThe country will lease a NASAMS system from Norway, buy two VL MICA fire units from MBDA and an IRIS-T SLM system from Germany's Diehl Defence.\n\n\"The systems will be operational from approximately around end of 2025 to the beginning of 2027, NASAMS anticipated to be the first,\" the ministry said.\n\nThe bill for pulling together the initial capacity will be more than 6 million kroner, which includes operating costs for \"a certain amount of time,\" the MoD said.\n\nThe four systems cover the initial capacity requirement, with no further systems in the pipeline for now, the ministry said.\n\nFor the longer term, Denmark has \"not yet fully decided\" whether it needs more short- to medium-range systems, nor whether the country will continue to operate multiple systems or eventually pivot to a single system, according to the ministry.\n\nThe planned purchase of the long-range system is referred to as \"a permanent solution,\" the Danish MoD said, with the combined budget for short- to medium-range and long-range systems about 19 billion to 25 billion kroner, including operating costs for a certain amount of time.\n\nFor comparison, Belgium, another country that lacks any ground-based missile defense, last month announced a budget of \u20ac2 billion (US$2.3 billion) to buy and operate 10 NASAMS systems from Kongsberg, as well as another \u20ac2 billion for three long-range air-defense systems.\n\nAround the Baltic Sea, other countries are also building up their defenses, with Estonia on July 30 announcing plans to establish a dedicated air-defense brigade and buy additional IRIS-T, Piorun and Mistral systems, as part of \u20ac10 billion in defense spending over 2026-29.\n\nDenmark's neighbor Sweden in June announced the purchase of seven additional IRIS-T SLM systems for around 9 billion Swedish kronor (US$805 million), while Norway that same month contracted new NASAMS systems for as much as 4.8 billion Norwegian kroner ($468 million) to replace equipment donated to Ukraine.\n\nDenmark and Sweden acquired their IRIS-T systems under the umbrella of the German-coordinated European Sky Shield Initiative, with countries including Slovakia and Switzerland also buying the Diehl system through the initiative this year.",

    "title": "US Army's Dark Eagle hypersonic missile migrates to Australia",
    "content": "The deployment highlights deepening U.S.-Australia defense cooperation and aligns with a broader Pentagon strategy to invest over $10 billion in hypersonic weapon systems to maintain strategic advantage.\n\nThe U.S. Army's Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon arguably bears one of the coolest names in the Department of Defense's arsenal. Called \"Dark Eagle,\" it was recently deployed outside the continental United States for the first time, making its overseas debut during this year's Talisman Sabre military exercises in Australia's Northern Territory.\n\nWe still don't know if any missiles were actually fired, but the arrival of the Dark Eagle in Australia marks a major milestone for the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. It's also a significant advancement in American long-range strike capabilities.\n\n\"This deployment validates the Army's ability to position and operate the system in a forward environment,\" Admiral Samuel Paparo said. He's the commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. \"It demonstrates our capacity to project power and support the defense of Australia, a key ally in the region.\"\n\nDark Eagle is not just fast -- it's maneuverable. While intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) can reach hypersonic speeds (five times the speed of sound or faster), they can't change course mid-flight. That's where Dark Eagle -- and other hypersonics -- stands apart. It uses a hypersonic glide body, launched from truck-based platforms, to strike targets over 1,700 miles away at more than 3,800 miles per hour.\n\nThe missile climbs to the edge of space, flies through the upper atmosphere out of reach of most enemy defenses, then maneuvers toward its target. That makes it uniquely capable of penetrating China's so-called anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) bubble -- an array of missiles and sensors which were purpose-built to keep U.S. forces at bay in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nThe 3rd Multi-Domain Task Force (3MDTF), based in Hawaii, oversaw the Dark Eagle deployment as part of the biennial Talisman Sabre exercise. TS25 brought together over 40,000 troops from the United States, Australia and 17 other nations.\n\nCol. Wade Germann, commander of the 3MDTF, called the deployment \"a major milestone\" and a demonstration of America's commitment to Indo-Pacific security. Photos from the event show U.S. soldiers briefing Australian counterparts on the system, signaling growing interest from Canberra. Australia is now exploring potential hypersonic collaboration through its 10th Brigade based in Adelaide.\n\n\"This system changes the game,\" Lt. Gen. Joel Vowell of U.S. Army Pacific said. Australian defense analyst Mick Ryan echoed the sentiment, calling Dark Eagle \"a great capability ... ground-launched, low-signature, and able to fire and retreat under cover.\"\n\nThe development of Dark Eagle is tightly aligned with the Navy's Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) missile, sharing a common hypersonic glide body and booster. The Army launches its version from mobile land-based trailers, while the Navy plans to fire CPS from its Zumwalt-class destroyers and Virginia-class submarines.\n\nTogether, these hypersonic platforms are designed to neutralize the \"archers\" before they can launch their \"arrows\" -- a reference to enemy missile systems that threaten U.S. and allied forces in the region. The Army and Navy's efforts complement the Air Force's Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon, recently tested in the Pacific. ARRW was shelved by the Biden administration after the successful testing because of escalating costs. However, the Trump Administration is reviving the program with a $387.1 million infusion in its FY 2026 budget.\n\nEach Dark Eagle missile costs an estimated $41 million, and the Department of Defense has earmarked over $10 billion in the next fiscal year's budget for hypersonic weapons development and acquisition. While critics say the U.S. is already spending too much money on defense and could use that money elsewhere, proponents of hypersonics argue the high price tag is justified given the strategic advantage the weapons provide.\n\nA full battery of Dark Eagles consists of a command and control vehicle, support vehicle, and four Transporter Erector Launchers (TELs), each equipped with two rounds. The Army said it plans to field its first full battery of Dark Eagles by the end of the year.",

    "content": "Russia has officially withdrawn from its moratorium on the deployment of intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles (INF). This move paves the way for potential tests of the new \"Oreshnik\" missile systems at the Kapustin Yar range. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the cessation of the unilateral moratorium, citing the disappearance of conditions needed for compliance and placing responsibility on the United States and its allies. According to the ministry, there is ongoing deployment of U.S.-made land-based INF missiles in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe Kremlin suggests that the U.S. armed forces have allegedly completed tests of several new INF systems and have begun serial production. Reports indicate the transfer of U.S. missile systems to allied territories, including Denmark, the Philippines, and Australia, with plans to deploy Typhon and Dark Eagle systems in Germany by 2026. The Russian response will be based on an interdepartmental analysis of the U.S. and other Western missile deployments, said the foreign ministry's statement. In light of these developments, there has been a temporary closure of the airspace over the Kapustin Yar range in Astrakhan from August 4 to August 8.\n\nWhile Russia's Defense Ministry has not commented, Ukrainian analysts speculate that Moscow could conduct tests of the new \"Oreshnik\" intermediate-range ballistic missile system (IRBM), purportedly already in serial production. Analysts from Defense Express suggest these claims might involve as few as one battalion -- consisting of 2-3 mobile launchers and a few support vehicles being deployed at the range.\n\nThere is uncertainty around the production capabilities, but Russian analysts believe their defense industry could produce another \"Oreshnik\" battalion by the end of 2025. Conversations regarding the deployment of these missile systems, potentially in Belarus or Russia's European areas, appear intended to make an impact in the ongoing information conflict with the West.\n\nRussia has previously developed, tested, and deployed INF missiles, including Iskander-K cruise missiles, even before officially ending the moratorium. One such complex attacked Kyiv on July 31, 2025, skirting former INF Treaty limitations. On June 23, President Vladimir Putin announced the ramp-up of the \"Oreshnik\" missile system production, boasting of its combat effectiveness.\n\nAt the start of January 2025, the U.S. successfully conducted a live-fire exercise using the medium-range surface-to-surface missile system known as the Typhon Weapon System, a crucial component of the U.S. Army's strategy within the 500 to 1500 km range.",

    "title": "Gainey addresses 2025 SMD Symposium",
    "content": "HUNTSVILLE, Ala. - The leader of U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command said during his address at the 28th Space and Missile Defense Symposium in Huntsville, Aug. 5, that as the air and missile defense threat environment continues to grow more complex, the Army and the nation can depend on the command.\n\nLt. Gen. Sean A. Gainey, USASMDC commanding general, focused on the Army's integrated air and missile defense efforts, Army Space, and the Army's newest military occupational specialty, the 40D MOS, during his speech reflecting the symposium's theme of \"Space and Missile Defense - Defending America at Home and Abroad.\"\n\nGainey said that as the enterprise enters a new space and missile age - space no longer a benign environment but a contested domain critical to modern warfare - visionary leadership must ask not only, \"What if,\" but \"What's next?'\"\n\n\"Combat credibility demands a strong focus on developing resilient space systems and counter-space capabilities to protect U.S. assets and deny adversaries access to space,\" Gainey said. \"Both Russia and China have made it clear that they intend to compete with us in space. We must make it clear that it's a competition they can't win.\"\n\nHe said SMDC's 1st Space Brigade is integrating close combat space interdiction into corps-level maneuver exercises, helping to isolate enemy long-range fires brigades and working to disintegrate enemy counterattacks. The creation of the new 40D Space Operations military occupational specialty, which goes live in 57 days, will bolster that mission.\n\n\"This is the first space-specific MOS for enlisted Soldiers, and it couldn't have come at a better time,\" Gainey said. \"The establishment of 40D MOS will alleviate the burden on other Army branches who are lending their Soldiers to space operations. This new space operations MOS is designed to build a robust and experienced noncommissioned officer corps in Army space and will ensure that Army space formations are equipped with Soldiers who have experience in space operations.\n\n\"They will learn all aspects of space operations and global missile defense, becoming the senior enlisted advisors who can provide the vital, close space support that our Army will depend on in years to come and laying the groundwork for continued growth in Army space,\" he added.\n\nMoving to integrated air and missile defense, Gainey said adversaries are increasingly turning to air and missile weapons as their tools of choice for deterrence, retaliation and conflict.\n\n\"It's no coincidence that as we enter this new air and missile age, the U.S. Army AMD force is undergoing the most significant modernization in our history,\" he said. \"Air and missile defense is the offensive line for the Army's close combat forces. We stop the rush from drones, missiles, and air threats to enable fires and maneuver. Like every great football team, you need a great offensive line to win.\"\n\nGainey said that over the next several years, the Army will field game-changing systems and software, starting with the Integrated Battle Command System.\n\n\"IBCS enables tailorable formations that can be dis-aggregated across terrain to meet the operational and tactical need,\" he said. \"Given our historical reliance on organic system sensors, IBCS's ability to use data from multiple sensors and create a composite firing solution sparks a fundamental change in how we fight.\"\n\nHe said that to compliment the IBCS, the Army will field the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor, replacing our workhorse -- the Patriot radar; Indirect Fire Protection Capability; and Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense. Gainey said the next steps will also include a leaner version for light units, and additional counter-unmanned aircraft systems sets.\n\n\"Warfighting for today and tomorrow requires us to do things differently,\" Gainey said. \"The arc of warfighting is bending toward autonomous, remotely operated, and artificial intelligence-enabled systems. Army air and missile defense is no exception.\n\n\"Human and machine integrated formations, offensive and defensive integrated launchers, battle management with artificial intelligence functions to reduce cognitive load, cheaper and faster procurement, and continuous transformation across both time horizons and the breadth of our systems guide us as we continue to build combat ready formations that are leaner, faster, more lethal, and driven by the Army's warrior ethos,\" he added.\n\nLooking forward, Gainey said we don't wait for solutions to come to us, and we don't settle for status quo.\n\n\"Creating all-domain advantage requires an active posture,\" he said. \"Consider our continued commitment to developing and implementing the missile defeat concept. Think of missile defeat as an encompassing framework. It includes those non-kinetic actions taken to delay, disrupt, degrade, and, ultimately, reduce the number of threats our forces must intercept in the air. Missile defeat is no longer a novel idea; it's a strategic imperative. Put simply, missile defeat effects will be required to win in 21st century warfare.\"\n\nGainey said one of the things that makes SMDC special is the innovation laboratory within its four walls.\n\n\"The synergies between the Tech Center, Center of Excellence, and warfighting units allow SMDC to invent, test, and field equipment with direct interaction between the minds developing new technologies and, ultimately, the Soldiers who will be using that tech in the field,\" he said.\n\nGainey emphasized SMDC is continuing to lead the important work of building the Army Air and Missile Defense Strategy 2040 and said the command is taking stock of lessons learned from the field, the increased options that artificial intelligence and advanced technology present, and we are getting back to the basics.\n\n\"The Army AMD Strategy 2040 describes the fundamental changes in how we will fight in mid-century combat with tailorable formations that can be dis-aggregated across terrain for defense and to create pockets of air and missile superiority where needed most,\" he said.\n\nGainey said future Army and Department of Defense initiatives to defend against advanced air and missile attacks continue to highlight the synergies between our space and missile defense industries.\n\n\"Space and missile defense superiority are interdependent,\" Gainey said. \"Success requires layered and integrated teamwork across an architecture. That includes capability that the Army can bring to bear in a terminal defense role, and the Army is integrated into the build of that design.\n\n\"Within the last decade, potential adversaries have developed more advanced and lethal long-range weapons, including ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles capable of striking the homeland with conventional or nuclear payloads. These comprise the most catastrophic threat to our homeland,\" he added. \"At SMDC, we are leaning our shoulders deeper into the task of homeland defense. I look forward to working with U.S. Northern Command, U.S. Space Command, Missile Defense Agency and other stakeholders as we continue to build and develop the next-generation defensive architecture that will keep our nation safe for years to come.\"",
