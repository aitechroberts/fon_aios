2 Deep-but-safe rollbacks
Prefect 3 ships a transaction API—any exception rolls back the work inside the context. The low-touch wrapper looks like:

python
Copy
Edit
from prefect import transaction

@task
def write_to_neo(docs):
    with transaction():                      # atomic block for Neo4j
        ...
@task
def push_search_vectors(docs):
    with transaction():                      # atomic block for Search
        ...
transaction() automatically commits on success or rolls back on failure; see the API details for fine-grained control over isolation and nesting.

Recommended depth

External system	Wrap?	Why
ADLS Gen 2	✅	blob uploads can be retried idempotently
Azure AI Search	✅	avoid partial vector batches
Neo4j	✅	Cypher MERGE statements are atomic inside one session

3 Linking Azure AI Search vectors ↔ Neo4j nodes for hybrid queries
3.1 Dual-ID pattern
Layer	Key	Content
Document node in Neo4j & Search doc	doc_id = md5(url)	1-to-1 with each news article (vector stored in Search)
Canonical entity node in Neo4j & Search entity doc (optional)	entity_id = ulid()	Aggregated over all mentions; optional averaged vector

Document vectors give fine-grained similarity.

Entity vectors (optionally averaged) let you jump straight to a company/weapon-system, even if many docs mention it.

Store doc_id (and optionally entity_id) as plain strings in the Search index—non-vector fields live happily beside vector fields in the same index.

3.2 Hybrid query flow
Vector + keyword query hits Azure AI Search (search, vectorQueries) and returns top K doc_ids—hybrid queries are merged with RRF ranking by the service.

Pass those doc_ids into Neo4j:

cypher
Copy
Edit
MATCH (d:Document)<-[:MENTIONS]-(e:Entity)
WHERE d.doc_id IN $ids
RETURN e, d
From there you can expand paths ((:Entity)-[:SUPPLIES]->(:Program)) for explainability.

Optional: when you embed entities, you can also call the Search index with entity_id vectors to jump straight into the graph (GraphRAG / HybridCypherRetriever).

3.3 Handling multi-source updates
Each new article writes a new Document node with a vector and an edge (:Document)-[:MENTIONS]->(:Entity {entity_id}).

A scheduled aggregate task (weekly?) recomputes the Entity vector as the mean (or HNSW centroids) of its latest documents and updates the Search index in a single batch, keeping the entity representation fresh without bloating the index.

3.4 Schema sketch in Neo4j
cypher
Copy
Edit
CREATE CONSTRAINT doc_pk IF NOT EXISTS
ON (d:Document) ASSERT d.doc_id IS UNIQUE;

CREATE CONSTRAINT ent_pk IF NOT EXISTS
ON (e:Entity) ASSERT e.entity_id IS UNIQUE;
…and in Search (abridged):

jsonc
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "doc_id", "type": "Edm.String", "key": true,
  "name": "entity_ids", "type": "Collection(Edm.String)",
  "name": "content_vector", "type": "Collection(Single)", "vectorSearchDimensions": 1536
}
Hybrid search over content_vector and BM25 text happens transparently.

4 Putting it together in prefect.yaml
yaml

deployments:
- name: kg-ingest           # writes raw blobs only
  work_pool: azure-container-instance
  schedule: {cron: "0 11 * * *", timezone: America/New_York}

- name: kg-nlp-index        # NLP + Search + graph
  work_pool: azure-container-instance
  parameters: {}
  schedule: null            # triggered only by automation
automations:
- name: "run-nlp-index-after-ingest"
  trigger:
    type: event
    expect: ["prefect.flow-run.Completed"]
    match_related: {prefect.resource.name: "kg-ingest"}
  actions:
  - type: create_flow_run
    deployment: "kg-nlp-index"
No blob events, no extra cost—just one container spin-up per daily batch.

5 Next steps
Unit tests for the dual-ID mapping utilities (critical for upserts).

Indexers: if you prefer indexers over SDK pushes, add field-mapping rules so Search auto-hydrates doc_id and entity_ids.

LangChain / GraphRAG integration: both Azure AI Search and Neo4j already have retriever classes that speak hybrid search and graph traversal.

With these pieces you’ll have cost-efficient, event-driven batches, safe rollbacks, and tightly coupled vector-graph retrieval ready for production.
